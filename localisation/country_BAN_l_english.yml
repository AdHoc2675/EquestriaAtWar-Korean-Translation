bandit.1.d:0 ""그리폰 여러분." 블랙록은 그녀가 작전실이라고 즐겨 부르던, 커다란 지역 지도를 벽에 못박아 놓은 널찍한 곳에서 군중들에게 연설했습니다.  "아시는 바와 같이 프리웬에서는 내전이 몇 년째 계속되고 있고, 양측은 완전한 승리를 달성하기 위해 과감한 조치를 취하고 있습니다. 하지만, 이것은 그들이 약하다는 것을 의미하고, 만약 우리가 그들의 땅에 우리를 초대한 다음 약간의... 쇼핑을 해도 그들은 저항할 수 없을 것이라는 것을 의미합니다. 그래서 침략을 할까요, 말까요?"\n\n그녀가 예상했던 대로, 그리폰들은 즉각적으로 이 행동에 대해 서로 큰 소리로 다투기 시작했고, 어떤 그리폰들은 싸움을 벌이기도 했고, 어떤 사람들은 프라웬의 땅은 어떤 대가를 치르더라도 피해야 할 "지옥의 불구덩이"라고 소리쳤습니다. 신이시여, 그녀는 그들이 병아리처럼 말다툼하는 것을 싫어했습니다. 그녀는 권총을 꺼내 천장에 한 발을 쐈고, 천장에 새로운 구멍이 생겼습니다. 이게 처음 있는 일은 아닙니다. \n\n"철없는 애들마냥 으르렁거리지 말고 질서정연하고 비폭력적인 방식으로 여러분의 의견을 제시하세요. 프리웬을 침공해요, 말아요?""

Members of the Bluecrest dynasty were once loyal servants of the Kings of Griffonstone and have always been friendly with our Prince's house of Whitecrest. We have supplied them weapons and advisors, and in return the Countess has officially proclaimed that she will come to our aid whenever we need it. In return, [LUS.GetLeader] is more than happy to promise the same. Let our houses be united in friendship for centuries to come! Together we will weather any storm."

bandit.6.d:0 "이웃의 무법천지 블랙할로우에서 온 편지가 오늘 도착했습니다. 사실 제안이라기 보다는 공개 위협이라고 표현하는 것이 더 정확할 것입니다. 악명 높은 도적 지도자인 블랙록은 우리나라가 그들의 조공국이 될 것을 요구하고 있습니다... 그렇지 않으면 그녀의 부랑자들이 계속해서 우리 땅을 습격할 것입니다."
bandit.6.a:0 "우리를 가만히 내버려두게 해준다면, 좋다."

bandit.7.t:0 "우리의 제안이 거부되었습니다!"
bandit.7.d:0 "Our best attempt to convince our neighbour into accepting a mutually beneficial relationship has been rejected. Blackrock will be furious, undoubtedly. She will likely blow off some steam by raiding the arrogant bastards."

bandit.8.t:0 "그리폰스톤 강탈"
bandit.8.d:0 "블랙록은 마을 바로 바깥에 있는 건초 더미 위에 앉아 있으면서 스멀스멀 웃었습니다. 일은 마무리되었고, 도적 여왕은 오늘 밤 습격하기로 선택했던 작은 마을을 마지막으로 떠나는 새들을 보면서 담배에 불을 붙였습니다. 그녀의 약탈꾼 일행이 그녀의 뒤에 모여 무슨 일이 일어날지 기뻐하며 기다리고 있었습니다. 그들은 모두 찾을 수 있는 모든 것을 약탈물로 가득 채운 큰 자루를 가지고 있었습니다. 지역 주민들은 오래 전에 떠났습니다. 음, 그러니까 총에 맞지 않은 주민들만 말입니다. 그리고 지금, 하룻밤 동안 다른 그리폰들의 노고를 훔치고 왔으니 이제는 기운을 좀 낼 때입니다.\n\n블랙록은 담배를 거의 다 태운 상태에서 목소리를 높였습니다. "우리는 곧 떠날 거다, 이 형편없는 펭귄들아. 감자자루 그리폰스톤 정부라고 불리는 것들이 곧 우리의 익살스러운 일을 알게 될 거다." 그리폰은 그녀의 발치에 멋진 웅덩이를 만든 휘발유를 바라보고, 이 마을을 이루는 몇 채 안되는 집들을 향해 뻗어 있는 개울을 보며 아래를 내려다보았습니다. "쇼를 즐겨라."\n\n그녀가 발톱을 까딱거리자 담배가 땅에 떨어졌습니다. 한 줄기의 빛이 집들로 흘러갔고 눈깜짝할 사이에 마을은 불바다로 변했습니다. 그리폰스톤에서 할 일은 끝났습니다!"
bandit.8.a:0 "집으로 갈 시간이다, 얘들아."

bandit.81.t:0 "도적단 약탈"
bandit.81.d:0 "It seems that Blackrock’s Bandits have crossed our borders. These scourges have descended upon our countryside like a swarm of locusts, leaving nothing standing and retreating home before the police or the army could react. Some griffons are angry and the lords demand retribution for these ungodly acts. Others say we are too poor and weak to retaliate and have no other option than to pray to Arcturius so he can protect us from further raids."
bandit.81.a:0 "범죄자들은 대가를 치르게 될 것이다."
bandit.81.b:0 "Have faith in Arcturius..."

bandit.9.t:0 "의기양양"
bandit.9.d:0 "The depressed denizens of Falcor are the perfect consumers for our goods. With their hatred of Wingbardy, it is an easy entry point into the drug trade, with little competition from the Karthin Mafia. The trade is lucrative and Blackrock has spent the last three days deciding which extravagant luxury she was going to get for herself. A swimming pool? A marble statue of herself? A golden gun? With the drug money, everything was possible. It was a win-win, for her."
bandit.9.a:0 "Screw the rules, I have money!"

bandit.91.t:0 "마약 전쟁"
bandit.91.d:0 "Recently, drug-related deaths have increased drastically. Cheap drugs have been flooding in over the borders and from the few smugglers we managed to capture, the source is clear. The Blackrock Bandits over in Blackhollow. Somehow, these griffons have managed to find truckloads of narcotics and they have chosen our country to start their drug empire. The police is doing the best they can, but with so many new drug-addicts and the rise of all sort of crime coming with it, we will be fighting the war on drugs for a long time."
bandit.91.a:0 "We will protect the [Root.GetAdjective] Way!"

bandit.10.t:0 "시카메온 연합체"
bandit.10.d:0 "Blackrock smirked as she took a piece of paper from one of her lieutenants. Her infiltration of Sicameon was going well. She looked at the numbers. Two dozen new recruits, 3 murders of griffons who had ‘moral objections’. And the decentralised mess that was her south-western neighbour was unable to coordinate efforts.\n\n"Two-hundred-ninety-four." She said it slowly, chuckling to herself. 294, the amount of independent police departments in Sicameon. Most of the time the policegriffs were too busy with local issues to help each other fight her network of bandits. Of course, the money flowed in. Blackrock dismissed her lieutenant, putting down the paperwork to play with a coin in her talon. Like she always said; It was good to be bad."
bandit.10.a:0 "Crime pays."

bandit.101.t:0 "우리를 표적으로 삼은 블랙록"
bandit.101.d:0 "Blackrock or ‘The Bandit Queen of Blackhollow’ as she apparently styles herself, has targeted our country. She has recruited and coordinated local criminals into a true syndicate of efficient heisting. Before the local police can make a good case, the griffons fly to the next parish, trusting the rough terrain and our localised administration will make it so we won’t follow them. Everytime we get somegriffon to talk about the organisation, they get murdered somehow, indicated that some policegriffs were involved too. It will take a long concentrated effort to track these petty criminals down, but justice will win out in the end."
bandit.101.a:0 "We are stronger than she thinks."

bandit.11.t:0 "양귀비 재배지"
bandit.11.d:0 "The wilder parts of Cyanolisia have turned out to be excellent for growing drugs and setting up workshops for making the synthetic parts. The wilderness has turned into quite the productive enterprise and with some well-placed bribes, the enterprise has managed to elude the authorities. From there couriers smuggled the tablets away on their way to some (un)lucky customer.\n\nOf course the waste for all those products had to be dumped somewhere and Blackrock was certain that in a hundred years, all these chemicals would turn Cyanolisia’s forests into a second Scheißwald. But that wasn’t really her problem now, was it?"
bandit.11.a:0 "Who wants to live forever?"

bandit.102.t:0 "도적단 오염"
bandit.102.d:0 "The forest rangers came back with a barrel leaking warm green fluid. It was the third find of drug waste this month and the problem kept getting worse. No griffon seemed to know where these drug industries were hiding, but they had to be somewhere in the wild. The criminals seemed to have a part of our country under their claw and it is up to the rangers and the police to take care of the problem."
bandit.102.a:0 "Boreas preserve the just."

bandit.12.t:0 "공장 건설 완료"
bandit.12.d:0 "We've put the captives from our most recent raid to good use. As it turns out, some of them have experience in constructing and designing industrial plants. While we have some standards and don't allow slavery here, unlike those shifty zebras, we've promised to set them free if they were to build us a factory. Surprisingly, these griffons did their task with minimal complaint, and now we have a new liquor factory."
bandit.12.a:0 "Excellent."

bandit.13.t:0 "군대 작업장 완공"
bandit.13.d:0 "Through intimidation and coercion, we've got the worthless peasants to build and operate a workshop for producing shiny new firearms. Our diligent overseers will ensure our quotas are met, and that some sort of decent labour experience exists. The second part is optional, of course."
bandit.13.a:0 "More guns!"

bandit.14.t:0 "사기꾼들의 유입"
bandit.14.d:0 "Following the mass escapes from various high security prisons across southern Griffonia, a large number of these hardened, vicious griffons have made their way to our lands, seeking sanctuary from the law. We welcome these dashing rogues, provided they refrain from causing excessive trouble."
bandit.14.a:0 "We'll put them to good use."

bandit.15.t:0 "잔인한 도적들"
bandit.15.d:0 "News has reached Murkbeak about an secluded mountain village being burned down and all of its inhabitants gunned down. From what we could piece together, Gaston, a notoriously dim griffon, was attempting to extort a tribute from the villagers. After they could offer nothing but the clothes off their backs and old grain, Gaston, in a fit of rage, ordered his griffons to slaughter and raze the village to the ground. Afterward, he was strutting around and telling to anyone who'd listed, that they had it coming for being poor."
bandit.15.a:0 "Regrettable, but isn't a real issue."

bandit.16.t:0 "Drunken Disaster"
bandit.16.d:0 "Our firefighters - who also serve as racketeers, bodyguards and fences, depending on the day - had their claws full last night, after an arms factory had suddenly caught fire and burned down to the foundations.

Thus, to teach them a lesson, we've raided one of the weaker holds and depleted it of its inhabitants. The late noble was so kind to leave us a large amount of precious stones and ornaments."

Showing that there is no honour among thieves, these daring griffons have plotted to abscond with the boss' riches for a long time, and last night, their efforts came to success as they stole Blackrock's entire stash of stolen jewelry - which she enjoys taking from those stiff necked nobles - and fled as quickly as they came.

First the town was surrounded with raiding parties emerging from the forest and cutting off any road connections to it, then some cannons were set up on the opposite side of the river. The bombardment began and drove the bandits into the castle, allowing the Countess' griffons to seize the town. The precious castle would not be damaged and was instead left alone. The criminal scum stuck inside would eventually starve and surrender. Countess Cyrille, who had led the attacking forces personally, sat on the old throne of the Bluecrest Counts and almost cried from joy. She was back home."

There, they could prepare for their attack peacefully, unseen by Blackrock's scum. A series of surprise raids cut off all roads leading to the town of Blackhollow, and sharpshooters secured the riverbanks, shooting any bandit ships sailing down the river. As Reeve lead his followers to attack the town, the cowardly bandits retreated into the castle, the old symbol of feudal oppression. Reeve immediately ordered cannons to be set up for the complete demolishment of the building. After three days of bombardment, nothing remained except a pile of smouldering rubble and corpses."

bandit.30.d_neutral:0 "The land of Blackhollow contains very little arable land, with most of it being around Lake Murk. Yet even here, perilous marshes are scattered everywhere. The capital of the region, Murkbeak, has grown after Blackrock's wicked reign began and is now the largest town in the country. It is a vile hive of scum and villainy, filled with the worst griffonkind has to offer. While Blackrock never stays in one place for long, the closest thing to her "home" is in the center of Murkbeak, where she stores her trophies.\n\nThe battle of Murkbeak would be hard, yet if the Countess took it, it would be a great victory that would shatter the morale of the bandit scum. Farmers around the town, who gave away most of their food as tribute to the criminals, eagerly joined the Countess when her forces arrived in the region. Soon enough bandit outposts had been destroyed and Murkbeak was surrounded by a large host of angry griffons. Cyrille was confident, but then she saw that Blackrock herself was leading the defenders and organized a solid defence, with many barricades on the streets and snipers on the roofs. The battle would be bloody.\n\nThree times the Countess' supporters attacked, and three times they were repulsed. Some machine guns stolen from Falcor had been set up and in the center of the town there was an artillery battery seized from Angriver. Hundreds died, mostly on the Countess' side. It was clear a direct assault could only end in failure, so instead the Countess tried a different approach. In the nearby marshes, packs of Hydras prowled. They could easily regenerate their wounds and did not fear the sound of gunshots. The Countess sent a group of her soldiers to harass and lure the Hydras away from the swamps into Murkbeak. The plan worked and soon the bandits fled in droves as massive hydras tore through their lines, still alive even as some of their heads were torn apart by artillery shells, constantly regenerating their wounds. The rampage lasted for several hours. After the Hydras were finally killed, some by Blackrock herself, it was followed by a swift attack by the Countess' forces. The bandits were utterly defeated and flew away, some being shot in mid-air. Blackrock managed to escape but her own fortress was looted bare."

While Blackrock never stays in one place for long, the closest thing to her "home" is in the center of Murkbeak, where she stores her trophies.\n\nReeve knew taking Murkbeak from the bandit oppressors would be difficult, at least if they tried attacking from the outside. His scouts reported that Blackrock herself was leading the defenders and organized a solid defence, with many barricades on the streets and snipers on the roofs. But an attack from within combined with an attack from beyond would surely crush their defence. He sent griffons to the surrounding countryside to recruit farmers, who gave away most of their food as tribute to the criminals, and also sent infiltrators and spies into Murkbeak disguised as criminals. There they told the local enslaved servants and workers that their liberation would come, but only if they took up arms and fought.\n\nWhen Reeve attacked, Blackrock was ready for him. Some machine guns stolen from Falcor had been set up and in the center of the town there was an artillery battery seized from Angriver. But she was not ready for the attack from behind her lines as the proles rose up, armed with tools and stolen guns. She had to split her defence and fight on two fronts, which soon proved to be unwinnable. Nevertheless Reeve's revolutionaries and the rebelling servants took hundreds of casualties and paid dearly. Blackrock herself managed to wound Reeve in the eye with an accurate rifle shot. But soon she realized that the battle was lost and her bandits fled in droves, flying away from the town. She cursed Reeve's name and fled as well rather than fighting to the last. Afterwards Reeve, with a bandage on his eye, raised the red flag of revolution on top of Blackrock's fortress and proclaimed Murkbeak to be the new capital of the commune. Soldiers and rebels alike cheered and celebrated the arrival of equality in Murkbeak."

The eastern principalities had expected him to attack from the north or the south, and they were completely taken by surprise as Grover invaded from the west and occupied their towns and cities. The minotaurs who had ruled the mountains protested to the Emperor and demanded him to give them back. He responded by crushing their army and seizing their mainland states which later became the County of Cyanolisia. It is said the castle in Talltower was built by his engineers to guard the pass he used and ensure no one in the east would try to use it like he had done. Nowadays it was a bandit stronghold where they prepared raids to Cyanolisia and Sicameon.\n\nCapturing Talltower and driving the bandits away from the Creeper Mountains would be difficult, so the Countess picked the finest mountaineers and the bravest fliers from the ranks of her soldiers for a two-pronged assault on Talltower. One company would attack from above, another from the valley below. This plan worked well: As the bandits focused on repelling the mountaineers, they were ambushed from the skies and could not use cover to hide from the sudden onslaught. The castle was taken after brutal close quarters combat, from the top floor to the bottom. Several days passed as the soldiers then surveyed the surrounding mountains and destroyed scattered bandit hideouts."

To show an example to his soldiers, he would personally lead the daring attack south. He gathered most of the revolutionaries as he believed numbers were necessary for victory, and one by one captured scattered bandit outposts in the mountains before only Talltower remained, its garrison too bold to surrender. Reeve decided to use his single advantage and attacked from above, leading all his numerous soldiers in a large swarm that blotted out the sun. The bandit sharpshooters on rooftops were shaken, especially when their gunfire did little to stop the attackers. The cloud of revolutionaries descended upon Talltower, slaughtering the outnumbered bandits with ease and besieging the castle. The few defenders inside held out for two weeks before running out of food and surrendering. Their wings were cut off and they were thrown down from the cliff as Reeve raised the red flag atop the castle."

So fittingly, her reign of terror will now end where it began.\n\nCountess Cyrille began a task that her predecessors should've done long ago. She organized her finest soldiers into squads of bandit-hunters and trained them to fight with the same guerrilla tactics their enemy used. Then the soldiers were sent out to purge Banditplace. They made sure to only attack during night-time, and use hit-and-run raids to cause as much damage as possible while taking minimal casualties in return. Bandit groups were ambushed in the dales and snipers occupied the peaks. The bandit outposts were burnt and slain foes crucified to set an example. Soon enough bandits began to flee the region in droves, taking their ill-gotten goods with them. Some remained, hiding in caverns and secret tunnels, but Banditplace was now mostly in the Countess' claws."

Now a new age would begin in the nation and it would be heralded with the purging of Banditplace. The criminal pockets and hideouts were many, but they were scattered, and in the end Reeve had more than enough angry peasants on his side who were tired of being raided, robbed and extorted. So he assembled a mighty host to march eastwards and fill the valleys like a feathered flood. The small and spread out settlements stood no chance on their own, and one by one they fell.

Despite these setbacks, young Reeve had a passion for learning, and his dedication was rewarded with a foreign scholarship in New Mareland. During his studies, he learned of something he considered impossible - an equal commune, where everypony had everything they wanted, and nopony was superior.

His vision is now on the cusp of success."
