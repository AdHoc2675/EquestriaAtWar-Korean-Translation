 imperial.1.t:0 "기차 여행"
 imperial.1.d:0 "황제는 그의 건강 악화에도 불구하고 새로운 제국 철도 시스템을 선보이고, 그리고 더 중요한 이유인 그의 시대가 아직 끝나지 않았다는 것을 국민들에게 확신시키기 위해 기차를 통해 헤르츠란트를 가로지르는 여행을 시작하기로 결정했습니다. 여행에 대해 강력하게 반대하면서 계속 침대에 누워 있어야 한다고 주장하던 주치의들은 마지못해 그를 놓아주었습니다.\n\n귀족들과 평민들이 모두 그리펜하임의 새 기차역에 모여 황제의 출발을 구경했습니다. 빛나는 증기 기관차가 준비되었고, 쓸 수 있는 자금을 모두 털어서 고용한 최고의 금속 세공사들과 목수들이 만든 열 두 대의 화려한 객차가 그 뒤에 이어져 있었습니다. 여행은 길고 몇 주 동안 계획되어 있었기 때문에 황제의 모든 수행원들을 위한 충분한 공간과 보급품이 있어야 했습니다. 그로버 5세가 예상보다 늦게 그의 개인 자동차를 타고 도착하자 귀족들이 달려와서 그를 환영해 주었고, 황제의 철도 계획과 제국에 근대성을 가져오는 방법에 대해 칭찬을 늘어놓았습니다. 황제는 언제나 그랬듯이, 탐욕스러운 아첨꾼으로부터 진부한 말을 들으며 지친 표정으로 고개를 끄덕이고는 기침을 했습니다. 그는 중무장한 제국 기사단의 호위를 받으며 천천히 역으로 걸어갔습니다. 역에 도착하자 그는 이번에는 그의 계획에 대한 칭송과 비싼 열차 대신 토치와 빵을 달라는 간청을 하는 평민들에게 둘러싸였습니다. 그가 마침내 개인 열차에 들어가자, 그는 방해되게 하지 말라는 요청을 한 다음 자리에 앉아 한숨을 쉬고 낮잠을 잤습니다.\n\n열차가 굉음을 내면서 여행의 시작을 알렸습니다."
 imperial.1.a:0 "무슨 일 있겠어?"
 imperial.2.t:0 "집으로"
 imperial.2.d:0 "기차 여행은 성공적이었습니다. 황제와 그의 호위대가 처음으로 방문한 브론제크루즈에서는 충성스러운 다이아몬드 독 귀족들이 그를 극도로 따뜻하게 맞이하며 그에게 많은 선물을 주었습니다. 그 후 그는 레데베터로 가서 친애하는 사촌이자 친구인 가브리엘라 이글클로 여공작과 이야기를 나눈 다음, 그리프킹 강을 건너 인근의 드 블루겔스로 가서 페디시아의 게라흐 4세 공작과 조용한 저녁을 즐겼습니다. 그의 다음 여행은 그를 올드윙부르크로 데려갔고, 그 지역의 농민 위원회는 철도에 대한 감사를 표시하기 위해 그들의 신선한 농산물을 제공했습니다.\n\n황제가 다음 목적지인 로마우 자유시에 도착하자 집정관 에리온 12세는 개인적으로 그와 정치에 대해 논의하기를 원했지만, 황제는 피곤했고, 악명높은 광신자와 이야기를 나누고 싶었지 않았기 때문에 거절했습니다. 다음날 그가 방문한 그린백에서 철도 계획에 종사했던 지역 엔지니어들이 그가 지금까지 여행을 즐겼는지를 알고 싶어했다. 안그리버로 향할 때가 되자 황제는 대신 집으로 돌아갈 수 있느냐고 물었지만, 그의 신하들은 신들이 원치 않을 것이며, 잔인한 리어 남작과 미친 디에르자 공주를 모욕하지 않도록 전체 여행을 끝내야 한다고 주장했습니다. 그는 불평하며 기차가 그리핑에 도착할 때까지 잠을 잤지만 가능한 깨어 있으려고 애썼습니다. 하지만 남작이 그를 만나는데 관심이 없었기 때문에 모든 것이 헛된 것으로 판명되었습니다. 카테린부르크 방문도 마찬가지로 신속하게 끝났고, 그들 모두가 저주를 한두번 정도 피했을 것입니다. 마침내 몇 주가 지난 뒤 여행이 끝나고 지친 황제가 집으로 돌아왔습니다.\n\n하지만 다음날 그는 침대에서 간신히 일어나 고통을 호소했습니다. 의사들은 그와 귀족들과의 긴급 회의가 끝나는대로 그를 확인해 보겠다고 약속했습니다. 그래서 황제는 귀족들을 만나서 졸지 않으려고 애쓰면서 그들의 사소한 불평에 귀를 기울이고 간청을 듣는 체 했습니다... 그가 갑작스럽게 쓰러질 때까지는 말입니다. 황제에게 조언하고 있던 집정관 에로스 7세는 신속하게 그의 왕좌로 달려와서 귀족들이 그를 망가뜨렸다고 비난했습니다. 황제가 의식을 잃었다는 것을 깨달은 90세의 그리폰은 그를 업은 뒤 도움을 요청하며 소리질렀습니다. 황제는 개인실로 급히 옮겨졌고 현재 제국의 최고 의료진들의 치료를 받고 있습니다. 집정관은 밤낮으로 신들에게 기도하며 시간을 보냈습니다."

 imperial.3.t:0 "왕의 죽음"
 imperial.3.d:0 "거의 한 달간의 치료와 치료에도 불구하고 불행하게도 황제 그로버 5세는 54세의 나이에 보레아스의 발톱에 포옹을 받았습니다. 그의 유일한 아들이자 후계자인 그로버 6세 왕자는 국가를 통치할 수 있는 나이가 아니기 때문에, 더 적절한 해결책을 찾아낼 때까지 귀족들, 상인 왕자와 교회 관리들로 구성된 비상 위원회가 국가를 인수할 것입니다..."
 imperial.3.a:0 "보레아스여, 우리를 구원하소서!"
 imperial.4.t:0 "집정관이 입장을 취하다"
 imperial.4.d:0 ""귀족들이 그로버 5세의 통치를 망치게 놔둔 나는 정말 바보였다. 보레아스라는 이름으로, 내가 아직 살아 있는 동안 그의 아들에게 같은 일이 반복되지 않도록 할 것이다."\n\n집정관 에로스 7세의 화난 발걸음이 제국 궁전의 화려한 홀에 울려 퍼졌습니다. 지금도 섭정 위원회의 귀족들은 다시 한 번 회의실에 모여 몇 시간 동안 무의미한 논쟁을 벌이고 있었습니다. 하지만 이번에는 다를 것입니다. 에로스는 원초적인 의지로 가득 차 있었습니다. 그는 역사가 반복되는 것을 허락하지 않을 것입니다. 그가 걸어갈 때마다 그의 마음속에서 과거의 추억이 떠올랐습니다. 그리펜하임이 불타오르고 있었고, 그는 눈에 공포가 가득한 젊은 그로버 5세를 데리고 궁전의 비밀 통로를 통해 안전한 곳으로 대피하고 있었습니다. 그는 눈을 감고 고개를 저었습니다. “다시는 안 된다.” 그가 중얼거렸습니다.\n\n늙은 집정관은 의회 회의실 문을 쾅 닫았습니다. 방에 있던 귀족들과 상인들은 입을 다물고 놀란 표정으로 그를 돌아보았습니다. 시선을 받은 에로스는 열정과 분노의 목소리로 말하기 시작했습니다. “의회의 그리폰 동지들이여! 이제 무의미한 논쟁으로 다투는 건 충분한 것 같소. 이제는 단호한 행동을 취할 때요! 불손함, 탐욕, 그리고 우유부단함이 제국을 그 어느 때보다 파멸에 가까워지게 만들었소. 섭정 위원회에 결함이 있다는 것이 분명해 보이지 않소? 이 끔찍한 시기에 제국은 강력한 지도자가 필요하오. 그리고 황제가 지금은 그 위치에 적합하지 않기 때문에 다른 누군가가 그의 자리를 맡아야 하오. 그리고 나는 그 자리를 자기들만 돌보는 귀족한테 넘겨주지 않을 거요! 나는 섭정이 평민이어야 한다고 말하겠소. 그는 헤르츠란트에서 안정과 질서를 회복할 수 있을 만큼 강력한 의지를 가져야 하며. 또한 신들과 가까워서 보레아스가 우리에게 번영을 줄 수 있고, 아이르는 우리에게 평화를 줄 수 있고, 아크투리우스는 우리에게 우리의 적들을 공격하고 황제의 뜻에 반대하는 놈들을 파괴할 힘을 줄 수 있소."\n\n집정관은 의회 의원들을 뚫어지게 노려보며, 똑같이 사나운 시선으로 바라보고 있던 스트로베리 공국의 가브리엘라 이글클로 여공작과 눈을 마주쳤습니다. “누가 그런 위치에 적합한지는 우리 모두 알고 있을 것이오. 동의하지 않는 그리폰들은 곧 신들이 그들을 버렸다는 것을 알게 될 것이오."\n\n의회는 침묵에 휩싸였습니다. 잠시 후, 상인들과 평의회의 사제들이 일어서서 집정관에게 환호하기 시작했습니다. "우리는 집정관과 뜻을 같이 하겠소. 신들이 우리와 함께 있을 것이오!" 크론부르크의 대제사장이 말했습니다. 곧 다른 그리폰들이 합류해서 구호를 반복하여 가브리엘라와 귀족들로부터의 반대를 묻히게 했습니다.\n\n에로스는 희미하게 미소를 지었습니다. 마침내 정의의 때가 온 것입니다."
 imperial.4.a:0 "황제와 신들을 위하여!"
 imperial.5.t:0 "여공작이 입장을 취하다"
 imperial.5.d:0 ""불쌍한 그로버, 이 잔인한 세상에서 그는 너무 어리고 연약해. 하지만 기회가 변화와 함께 찾아왔다네."\n\n가브리엘라 여공작이 궁전의 홀을 걸어 내려가면서 생각했습니다. 그녀는 죽은 전 황제의 개인적인 친구였지만, 그가 적절한 통치자가 아니라는 것을 알고 있었습니다. 그녀는 그로버를 오랫동안 학대해온 귀족들과 같은 방을 쓴다는 것을 부끄러워했습니다. 하지만 나중에는 그 문제를 해결할 수 있을 것 같습니다. 보레아스가 그리폰을 다시 자랑스럽게 만들 것이며, 더 중요한 것인, 젊은 상속자가 나이가 들면 통치할 적합한 영토를 부여해 줄 것입니다. 하지만 먼저... 에로스와 그의 깡패들을 상대해야 합니다. 종교 관리들은 성가신 존재들입니다.\n\n그런 생각을 하며, 그녀는 의회 회의실에 들어섰습니다. 집정관은 이미 그곳에 있었고, 귀족들에게 "설교"를 하고 있었습니다.\n\n성가셔라. 그녀는 브론즈힐 백작 옆에 앉아 그녀의 연설을 준비하며 조용히 속삭이는 목소리로 상황을 논의했습니다. 가브리엘라는 늙은 집정관의 말을 무시하며 기다렸습니다. 그가 중앙 연단에서 내려오자, 기회를 잡은 그녀는 중앙으로 걸어가 의원들을 향해 말했습니다.\n\n"존경하는 귀족 동지들과 다른 그리폰들이여, 이 존경스러운 집정관은 이 상황에 대해 아주 잘 이야기하고 있습니다. 우리는 안정을 가져야 하고, 우리의 권위를 다시 주장해야 합니다. 하지만 어떻게 집정관 나으리가 우리의 나라에게 그걸 제공하라고 확신할 수 있을까요?" 그녀는 에로스와 그의 하인들의 찌푸린 인상을 무시했습니다. "그들은 전쟁에 대해 이야기하지요, 그런데 그들은 이 작은 그리폰에 대해서는 신경을 쓰는가요? 백성들을 돕지 않고 어떻게 사랑하는 헤르츠란트를 현대화하고 나아갈 수 있을까요? 여러분 모두 올바른 선택을 고려해주시길 간청합니다."\n\n환호와 박수갈채가 따라왔습니다. 소수의 조롱과 삿대질이 섞였지만, 중요하지 않았습니다. 의회는 섭정에 대한 그녀의 주장을 지지할 것이고, 소외된 에로스는 그가 속한 제단으로 돌아가야 할 것입니다."
 imperial.5.a:0 "제국과 귀족들을 위하여!"
 imperial.6.t:0 "크나큰 배신"
 imperial.6.d:0 "우리가 간신히 우리의 대의에 대한 섭정 의회의 지지를 확보한 지 거의 한 달이 지난 후, 이 모든 초창기 권력 투쟁 후에 마침내 수도의 상황이 진정되는 것처럼 보였습니다. 불행하게도 우리가 틀렸습니다. 오늘 의회 회의 중에 가브리엘라 이글클로 여공작과 그녀의 몇몇 동료들이 방을 나갔고, 브론즈힐, 페디시아, 그리펜하임의 영주들이 그 뒤를 따랐습니다. 몇 시간 후, 그들은 모두 제국으로부터의 공식적인 탈퇴를 발표했습니다..."

So, he announced the creation of the noble council and asked every prominent noble within his territory to come to one of the towers of the imperial palace to discuss the powers of this council.

The problem had progressed to the point that a revolution by his supporters seemed inevitable, and the eighth delay of the assassination proved to be the last straw for Ferdinand.\n\nHe grabbed his revolver and a squadron of his personal guard and drove off in his car. He arrived at the Archon's house and proceeded to kick the door in. Then he and his soldiers meticulously killed every single occupant of the house, until Eros himself was located.

What followed was a protracted battle that lasted for several days, as elite special forces from the Lord Protector's armies assaulted the redoubt, gradually wearing down the defenders, until the only ones that remained were Kemerskai and his personal bodyguards.\n\nAfter a final confrontation in which Kemerskai himself killed several of his assailants, he and his bodyguards were finally captured. The President-Marshal was shoved into an armored truck, which then made its way to Griffenheim, alongside a convoy of armored escorts. Despite being ambushed several times by republican guerillas as they made their way through former Republican territory, the convoy eventually managed to safely arrive at Griffenheim. \n\nA few days later, the former President-Marshal, the griffon who had brought a centuries-old empire to its knees, stood before the gallows in Griffenheim with his wings restrained and a rope around his neck. Lord Protector Ferdinand stood at a podium only a few feet away, giving a speech to the residents of Griffenheim, announcing that the evils of republicanism would finally be banished from the empire.

There was only one punishment worthy of such evils, and he was sentenced to be hung from the gallows at dawn.\n\nThe griffon offered no defense for himself, staying silent through the entire court case, seemingly having accepted his fate. The execution itself was a subdued event, with a scant few military officials and curious onlookers showing up. Of the few griffons present at the event, Elias Bronzetail was the most senior in rank, showing up out of the little respect that he had for the foolish general. There were no grand speeches or denunciations at the execution, Ferdinand was simply lead up to the gallows, and minutes later he hung dead in the air.\n\nIn the end, Ferdinand Dawnclaw died a mundane death, one which was observed by few. He would be a footnote in history, another mad general driven by a lust for power, an insignificant traitor whose pitiful rebellion was put down before it could even start in earnest.\n\nIt was a fitting end."

Several hours had passed from his arrival when he was already holding a speech in the center of the city. The market square was busy at that time, so soon the amount of griffons listening to him grew and a huge crowd formed around him as he kept on rambling and raving.\n\nHis speech was full of fury, so much so that he seemed more like an Archon of Arcturius. He condemned the nobility and called them decadent, lazy, corrupt, selfish, greedy, Maarite and several dozen other negative epithets. He blamed them for the Empire's decay, for Emperor Grover V's death, for the revolution of 978 and for every unfortunate event in the Empire's history. It was clear, he said, that the Empire needed to be purified and remade anew, the power of the aristocrats shattered and their plentiful land redistributed to Eyr's devout followers, for she was a Goddess of the Earth and Fertility and thus her bounty belonged to them. He asked the crowd how many of them worshipped Eyr and paid tithe to his Archonate, and most remained silent. Yet a few faithful ones raised their hands or flew upwards, and to them Erion promised vast tracts of land. Soon others in the crowd joined them and claimed to be followers of Eyr as well, vowing to donate as much as they could to Erion's Temple.\n\nErion grinned and said he would do everything he could to purge the unclean.

All free of charge of course, funded by the Archons themselves. The commoners were grateful and many had their first warm meals in a long time. They praised the Archons and word quickly spread of their piety and generosity.\n\nThose nobles on the regency council who complained of this "senseless waste of money" and "blatant bribery of the needy" soon found themselves replaced with commoners claw-picked by the Archons, as did the ones who whined about the replacements and said the regency council was reserved for privileged individuals only. One by one nobles were removed until only a few blueblooded griffons remained, among them Gabriela Eagleclaw. Her support was too great, Eros thought, and removing her could only end poorly. At least for now, he was willing to let her stay while they gathered popular support. Gabriela however had already realized what was happening, and already letters were being sent across Herzland..."

As always, he shrugged off such criticism and left the Palace to speak to the people he loved and cared about. Word of Proteus' arrival had spread quickly and a huge crowd gathered to listen to their hero's speech as peddlers tried to profit off the situation by selling Proteus-related merchandise.\n\nAs soon as the muscular Knight-Archon appeared on the balcony of the Imperial Palace, the griffons erupted into cheers and chanted his name. Many soldiers had gathered there too and hailed their living idol. Proteus smiled in return and basked in admiration for a long while, even winking to female griffons in the crowd who swooned from his attention. Behind him Eros rolled his eyes and angrily told him to get started already.\n\nProteus asked for the people to calm down and they obeyed him immediately. He then began to speak, of the present uncertainty and restlessness in Herzland, how many had doubts about the future and feared another revolution. Everyone was especially anxious about the lack of leadership. Proteus then told that in such times one had to be brave and look to Arcturius, and have confidence in Him and His divine protection. If they remained strong and faithful to their gods, no matter what would happen they would not only prevail but prosper. He urged the people to not simply sit idly and wait for what would happen, but make preparations for the worst and never give in to fear. Their greatest strength came from unity, and unity came from sharing a single, noble cause. And that cause was ensuring peace, stability and integrity within the Empire no matter the cost, so all griffons could live a good life. He ended his speech with "Praise Arcturius!" and saluted the crowd, who in turn cheered and praised not only the God of War but him as well. As he turned around to go back inside, he looked at Eros and grinned. Despite the audience's response, Eros seemed unimpressed."

When Eros was ready to once again rant to Proteus about his negligence and incompetence, he was surprised to see just how fond the army had become of him. Over the weeks he had practiced with low-ranking soldiers, discussed strategy with the officers and dueled with them. He had even organized a large sermon where they all prayed to Arcturius and he blessed the entire army in His name. As a result of all this, Proteus was now seen as the heroic figurehead of the Imperial Army and inspired countless thousands of soldiers.\n\nInstead of chiding Proteus, Eros decided to take advantage of his success. Printing presses began to churn out posters depicting Proteus as a knight clad in enchanted armour pointing at the viewer, with "ARCHON PROTEUS WANTS YOU TO JOIN THE IMPERIAL ARMY" written below in large, coloured letters. Tens of thousands of posters were plastered on lampposts, walls, fences, windows and trams. They proved to be very effective, with a constant stream of young griffons filling the recruiting offices and enlisting in the army."

 imperial.104.d:0 "Time is of the essence, thought Duchess Gabriela. Her little speech gathered support for her cause, but it was still inconclusive whom will the Council elect for the regency. The next matter to be discussed was the admittance of common-born griffons of some repute to the council... And that simply cannot be allowed. Eros' blatant populism would spell doom for the Empire if the actual commoners found out about it, and nogriff needs another 978. Fortunately, the opportunity presented itself.\n\nThe Grand Duke of Feathisia arrived in Griffenheim today, his coming unnoticed by most, as he was fond of travelling incognito. He was set to deliver his speech in the Council Chambers tomorrow, and while he is a pure-blooded noble, Gabriela suspected that the Archons' lackeys could persuade him to support an inferior cause. He can be irritatingly pragmatic sometimes. But the Duchess had her own plan in mind: she will invite him to dine at her Griffenheim estate and take advantage of his fondness for her in order to secure an alliance.\n\nThus, the evening came, the two noble griffons seated in front of each other at the Duchess' opulent dining room. Pleasant chatter was exchanged over a traditional Feathisian feast, with dishes such as snert and maatjesharing. Thankfully, he refrained from devouring the fish in primitive ways. It was certainly... unbecoming to be seen doing such. As Gabriela was about to make a comment on the latest gossip, she was suddenly interrupted by the normally tight-beaked Grand Duke:\n"Lady Eagleclaw, I do not wish to disrespect your hospitality, but I am keenly aware of your invitation's purpose." This came as no surprise to her, as she made a strong effort to flatter his sensibilities. In fact, he gave her an opening to cut straight to the matter at claw. "Forgive me, Grand Duke. But I believe it is within our mutual interest to stand together against the Archons and their wicked schemes. They can't be trusted to rule our legacy." As Gerlach silently considered his options, she pressed further: "Think, what would Grover want?" This got his attention, his eyes gleaming at the memory of the late Emperor... "So it is, Duchess. So it is."\n\nTomorrow, at the Council's meeting, Gabriela could only smugly listen to Gerlach's speech, lambasting the Archons for their irresponsible actions. This will certainly draw some of the indecisive nobles to vote for her regency. As his speech drew to a close, she thought about setting up another dinner. The Grand Duke is certainly easy on the eyes."

 imperial.105.d:0 "As Duchess Gabriela walked through the busy halls of Krähe-Stahl Offices, her thoughts were on legacy. The Empire may last for centuries or not even a decade, but its culture and achievements will never be forgotten. But where the state comes and goes, its inhabitants are eternal. And more importantly, the money. Great wealth is concentrated within the many companies dotting the business district of Griffenheim, and she knew that having their support could change it all. Thus, today she would dedicate her morning to one known as Ceron Greytalon, the most notable captain of industry in the city. He accepted her invitation for a meeting without hesitation, and before she knew it, she was sitting across the business magnate in his opulent office.\n\n"My dear Gabriela. What brings you to my humble workplace?", Ceron started with no hint of irony, chomping on his favourite Golden Griffon cigar, exclusive from Skyfall. "I'll need that favour you promised me, Ceron. I'll need your support, and your colleagues' assistance, against the Archons. You know we can't let them take over the state." Greytalon leaned forward, exhaling a whiff of smoke. The Duchess didn't seem to be hazed by it. "Your favours don't come cheap, Gabriela. What's in it for me, and for the Krähe-Stahl? I must work for my bread like every other griffon, you know."\n\nThe ever predictable Ceron and his greed. You'd think he had made enough in his lifetime, but some were never content. "Tax breaks. Subsidies. Exclusive government contracts. And we won't nationalise your factories, like the Archons would. They'd probably give it all to the peasants, too." Gabriela could practically hear the sound of Idols clinking in Ceron's head. Her offer would clearly improve his next quarterly report. "Then I believe we have an outstanding deal, my dear. The industrialists of the Empire will stand by your side." Claws were shaken, pleasantries were exchanged, and a proposal for the expansion of a middling business was drawn up. Primarily for the purpose of putting a good impression on the less fortunate, of course. The Duchess returned to her Griffenheim manor, an another piece of her plan put in motion. It wouldn't be long until she had everything she needed."

Many nobles were left disgraced once the attention of unflattering comments landed on them, regardless of whether there was any substance of truth in them. Sometimes, a noblegriff simply crossed the wrong peer... Such were the rules of the courtly intrigue, and Gabriela was keenly aware of them.\n\nWhich was why she decided to use these same tactics against the Archons. Although Eros and Proteus were unfortunately too beloved and incorruptible, the same could not be said for their weakest link, Erion. It was an open secret that he conducted himself in a manner considered shameful by even the Priesthood of Eyr's standards. Gabriela knew just how to exploit this situation: she was a friend of a local priest named Hephaestus, whose advancement was snubbed by Erion plenty of times. She was certain that he will be open to the suggestions of revenge, in exchange for an open seat in the Archonate, once the true order took control. With that, she began writing a letter, which would arrive tomorrow in Romau.\n\nThe following week saw plenty of controversy in Romau and beyond, as multiple accusations emerged targetting various high ranking religious officials. The common griffons were outraged to hear that their alms ended up funding extravagant parties, and worse yet, the tales of abuse committed upon young initiates. While many of these stories had few facts behind them, and while Archons still had their claws full on trying to minimise the extent of the damage, the public opinion swung back in the nobles' favour. Everything is according to Gabriela's plan."

Still, they were smart enough to keep it behind curtains, unlike certain lesser aristocrats. These landless lords would continuously make fools of themselves, clinging to their empty titles and dressing in fashion that went out of style decades ago. Despite being genuine wastes of Boreas-given air, Duchess Gabriela found a possible use for them.\n\nDespite holding functionally vacuous titles, of the lands that haven't been under Imperial control for decades, they were still peers, recognised by the Imperial Court. As such, should a sufficient number present their cause to the Regency Council, there would be no choice but to be accepted. Gabriela only needed a few more claws on her side to claim the regency for herself, and despite the distaste for their mockery of the peerage, went forth to persuade a sufficient number. It would be a busy day, but at least she knew where most of them spent their days. It would be a simple matter what to say and promise, and no guarantee for following on them later on.\n\nThe following day at the session of the Regency Council had an unusual commotion, as a dozen foppish nobles interrupted the session and demanded that "their privileges to be given and respected". The guards were close to kicking them out on the streets, but the Duchess interrupted, saying that their titles are legitimate. Thus they joined their colleagues, and when the vote came, they all voted unanimously for Gabriela Eagleclaw. The Archons were furious at being foiled yet again!"

 imperial.108.d:0 "President-Marshal Kemerskai was executed by hanging in the Imperial square in Griffenheim today. The people had anticipated this day ever since his capture at the hands of an elite griffon special forces unit during the fall of the bandit state known as the Griffonian Republic, and the crowd at the execution itself was truly massive. There was no trial given to Kemerskai, with the government stating that his crimes were so blatant and irrefutable that dignifying them with a trial would be akin to spitting on the very concept of justice. Any griffon who disagreed with this statement quickly changed his mind or was arrested as a Republican sympathizer.\n\nKemerskai was marched to the gallows and offered a cigarette, which he refused. The execution itself occurred mere seconds later and was closely observed by the Imperial Regent [Root.GetLeader] who was quite pleased to put an end to the disgrace the Empire has suffered for over 30 years, and the young Emperor himself, who flinched when the hanging took place but nevertheless was happy to see his father's humiliation finally avenged. The Griffonian republican movement is unlikely to recover after this event."

 imperial.109.d:0 "We have received a report from Oberst Synovial, head of our attaché to the Griffonian Empire. He tells us good news of war games which were recently held. Almost everyone in the attaché attended and took part in the simulated combat experience which lasted several days and allowed officers to put their tactics to the test in practice.\n\nThe newly trained griffon tank companies performed admirably and seemed to have learned their lessons from us. Meanwhile the changelings of our attaché adopted griffon tactics of defensive frontlines and managed to fend off several assaults.\n\nIn the end, both sides were tied and a draw was declared. While this was disappointing to some, in the end a celebration was held nevertheless. Thranx especially seemed to enjoy griffon cuisine and drink greatly. Perhaps worryingly so."
 imperial.109.a:0 "Truly a valuable field test."
 imperial.110.t:0 "The Nebelwerfer"
 imperial.110.d:0 "Oberst Synovial of our attaché to the Griffonian Empire has sent another report. This time, it contained detailed schematics and instructions for the construction and use of "smoke mortars", which the catbirds call "Nebelwerfer".\n\nWhile initially developed for creating smoke screens on the battlefield, they are now long-distance rocket launchers. Tests have shown their terrifying effectiveness, so Synovial recommends we adopt them into our artillery companies. They could prove very effective against the squishy pony scum."

It is about an industrial program where our own arms companies exchange their production methods and practices with the griffon ones and adopt them if they prove to be superior.\n\nThey claim this would be mutually beneficial and would allow for the expansion of our military production, but would also mean giving away any secrets we might have. We don't want the griffons to get too strong, do we?"

[From.GetLeader] wishes for this to change, and says we should create a joint department where changeling and griffon researchers work together and share their documents and data openly. Of course, this would mean sharing top-secret military breakthroughs with them in return for their own breakthroughs, so we must consider carefully if we want to accept this proposal."

We would share military doctrine, formations, organizations, tactics and more, and adopt the ones that seem beneficial to us.\n\nWhile the griffon way of war can continue to augment our own, this also means revealing everything we know about warfare to them.

 imperial.119.t:0 "The Changelings Decline"
 imperial.119.d:0 "Sadly, [From.GetLeader] has denied our offer for now. Sharing even more of our military tactics and doctrine would cross the line, apparently, and the current level of cooperation is enough and does not require expansion. It seems they jealously guard their military secrets and do not want to share them with anyone, even their closest allies.\n\nHowever, if we continue to reason and appeal to them, perhaps they will understand that cooperation could only be beneficial for both of us. That will take time and effort, however, as [From.GetLeader] can be very stubborn sometimes."

 imperial.120.t:0 "The Knecht-Jäger Officer Exchange Program"
 imperial.120.d:0 "The masters of Imperial knightly orders have met with our Jäger officers and exchanged their experience, doctrine and knowledge of war. Their knights displayed the effectiveness of enchanted armour and bold aerial assaults, while our Jägers showed how to fight in urban and forested environments and how to "hunt" the enemy like prey.

 imperial.123.t:0 "The March Of The Students"
 imperial.123.d:0 "The Emperor recently came of age, and is ready to rule his reunited Empire. But it is clear he must immediately get to work. Young students of a new generation, more well-educated and conscious than their parents, are calling for peace and freedom across the Empire. Throughout their life, they have known nothing but war, with mass-conscription and strict military production quotas. Now they are tired of it, and dream of a peace that is maintained, and a society that is demilitarized. While the old guard considers them republican sympathisers, the truth is that most of them see the benefits of Imperial rule, and simply want reform. And they want it NOW.\n\nToday thousands of griffons, if not tens of thousands of them, gathered in Griffenheim from all across the Empire. Most of them were students, but there were government personnel among them as well. They began something that had not been seen in the Imperial City since 978: A mass protest. However, it was not a riot, but a peaceful demonstration, with protesters calmly holding signs with slogans and calling for liberty, regional autonomy and reform of the state and the temples. Yet some among them were more radical, and tried to sway others to their side with fiery speeches. Several clashes with local police could not be avoided, but in general it was entirely peaceful. News have spread like wildfire, and smaller protests have already sprung up in support of the Griffenheim one in many Imperial Cities, in Griffonstone, Skyfall, Aquila, Karthin, Cloudbury and others.\n\nIt is clear that His Majesty Grover VI cannot ignore this movement. Above all, the students demand an end to the "dictatorship" which was maintained under the rule of the Imperial Regent. If Grover VI simply continues to act like a despot of old, it is not out of the question that the horrors of 978 are repeated. Either way, he will have to make appeasements; the question is, how far should he go? This time the decision is entirely his to make, and he cannot delegate it to a regent. The fate of the Empire is in his claws."
 imperial.123.a:0 "Oh dear..."
 imperial.124.t:0 "The Griffenheim Protests"
 imperial.124.d:0 "Soon after protests began, the police in the Imperial City began to restore law and order in the streets. Tensions were high between the students and the riot police, especially when some protesters saw this as proof of the Emperor's tyranny. This is why they were very surprised when an official Imperial decree ordered the police to stand down and to leave the protesters alone.\n\nIn Grover's eyes, the protests were almost entirely peaceful and non-violent, so he did not see them as a threat, unlike some of his advisors. Violence would only beget violence, so leaving them alone would ensure they remained calm. He even made a statement promising to listen to the demonstrators' demands, as long as they remained reasonable, and said force would not be used against them unless they were to use it first. This proved to be effective, as the rare violent incidents and clashes became even rarer."
 imperial.124.a:0 "It's a peaceful protest, what's wrong about that?"
 imperial.125.t:0 "The Reichsarmee Recalled"
 imperial.125.d:0 "To further calm and reassure the protesters, today His Majesty recalled all army units from protest sites across the Empire. They were on high alert, ready to intervene if necessary to prevent a revolution, and the roaring tanks patrolling the streets made many protesters both afraid and furious. So when the tanks and marching columns of soldiers returned to their barracks, the students rejoiced.\n\nWhile some advisors expressed their concern that now the Empire was vulnerable to an organized revolution, the Emperor called them paranoid and reassured them that it would be fine. Indeed, the protests remained calm on the following days, with no sign of escalation of violence or preparation for a coup."
 imperial.125.a:0 "See? Nothing bad happened."
 imperial.126.t:0 "The Talks"
 imperial.126.d:0 "A dozen leaders of the student movement from all across Griffonia received a letter today, which did not contain poison or a bomb like they expected. Instead, it was an official invitation to meet the Emperor himself at the Imperial Palace in [GRI.Capital.GetName]. While a few suspected a trap and a plot to arrest them, most of them trusted the young Grover and travelled to the capital. For some, it was a very lengthy journey, but they were determined to go nonetheless.\n\nThere, His Majesty treated them like honoured guests, welcoming them to his home and offering them a bountiful dinner. Six leaders in total had arrived: Cécile Gaudreau from Aquileia, Gallo Ventriglio from Wingbardy, Borad Grifnitsky from Gryphia, Heinrich Kingfeather from Cloudbury, Winston Copperhill from Bronzekreuz and Alexis de Sicameon. While their values varied, they all agreed that the Empire needed democratic reform, and acknowledged Grover VI as their rightful monarch.\n\nAfter the dinner the Emperor talked to them all in private, where they elaborated upon the goals of the student movements and their demands, while Grover reassured them that no harm would come to them if they did not resort to violence. They all agreed that it was out of the question, and that another bloody revolution would bring nothing but death. Peaceful reform was the way, and they convinced the Emperor that this would satisfy them and the protesters. While some of their demands were too extreme for Grover, he was convinced of the more moderate and reasonable requests. At the end of the meeting, he swore in the name of his father to implement these reforms and do what Grover V could not: Save the Empire from revolutionary chaos, turmoil and war. All six leaders left the palace satisfied, dreaming of a blissful future for the Empire and its people."
 imperial.126.a:0 "They seemed like reasonable folk."
 imperial.127.t:0 "The Reports"
 imperial.127.d:0 "Soon after lifting the censorship on the news coverage of the protests, the frontpage of every single regional newspaper, as well as the national newspaper Bürger, was filled with sensational headlines and numerous pictures depicting the protests. In the Bürger, a lengthy editorial contemplated if the Empire would accept the students' demands or spiral into chaos and revolution, some articles highlighted the wrongdoings by the police and military before they had been ordered to stand down, and a satirical caricature depicted Grover as a confused crying child in a burning house.\n\nRegional newspapers had different views on the matter. Le Petit Griffon saw this as a chance to secure autonomy for Aquileia, which the Aquileian Kingdom had had before its secession from the Empire. Campi Di Taloncana claimed that a parliamentary monarchy was inevitable, and that the Empire would introduce local democratic governments similar to the ones Equestria had. Flügel der Wahrheit, a newspaper that had once been the most popular one in Griffonia before being surpassed by the Bürger after the Empire's reunification, even had a scandalous headline claiming the Emperor would soon abdicate and be succeeded by a republican government. However, some newspapers espoused support for the Emperor: The Prywhenian Campu-Painii Liber, always a staunch supporter of the de Kissau dynasty, was confident His Majesty would soon crush the resistance, having lulled the protesters into a false sense of security by withdrawing the army and police.\n\nWhile the coverage has been largely negative, Emperor Grover believes the journalists deserve to have their opinions heard. Already heated debate has begun across the Empire about its fate, and without realizing it the subjects of the Empire are happily embracing the freedom of speech."
 imperial.127.a:0 "It was the right thing to do."
 imperial.128.t:0 "The Reforms of Grover VI"
 imperial.128.d:0 "Today marked the beginning of a new age for the Empire: His Majesty Grover VI passed his initial reforms which primarily focused on establishing the foundation for further change. Most notably, he dismissed advisors who had previously opposed his conciliatory stance with the protesters and greatly reduced the power of the Nobles' Council to the point there was very little they could do to influence governance and legislation. Many of the peers protested this act, given that the council has performed with admirable dedication and little-to-no scandals, but the Emperor cared little. But when they threatened to tell the old Duchess that her nephew was slandering the noblegriffs who worked so hard to raise Grover to the throne, he responded that the nobles serve the Empire, and not the other way.\n\nOther smaller reforms included legalizing protests of all kinds, prohibiting censorship, forbidding religious officials from participating in government, allowing all religions and sects (except for Maarites who remained banned) and recognizing every single regional language spoken within the Empire."

Most notably, he dismissed advisors who had previously opposed his conciliatory stance with the protesters and greatly reduced the power of the Three Archonates to the point there was very little they could do to influence governance and legislation. While some conservatives and religious figures protested this move, the Emperor cared little. But when someone said that he was spitting on the grave of Archon Eros, he was outraged and told him this is what Eros had wanted him to ultimately do.\n\nOther smaller reforms included legalizing protests of all kinds, prohibiting censorship, forbidding religious officials from participating in government, allowing all religions and sects (except for Maarites who remained banned) and recognizing every single regional language spoken within the Empire."

 imperial.130.t:0 "A Meeting With Van Cleef"
 imperial.130.d:0 "So far, Edwin Van Cleef, the leader of the underground Volksfront and a stonemason by trade, has been distrustful of Grover VI. He had been invited to a meeting with the Emperor like other prominent protest leaders, but refused it, thinking it was a plot to imprison him for his old attempts at terrorism. When His Majesty officially pardoned him alongside other Volksfront members, he was positively surprised and decided to trust the Emperor for now.\n\nThis is why he cautiously accepted a second invitation to meet the Emperor in person, this time without anyone else. Even when it was just the two of them inside Grover's office, he still glanced behind his back, fearing guards to burst inside to arrest him. But the Emperor reassured him with calming words and promises of peace. Indeed, Edwin let his guard down and talked with the Emperor for hours about the future of the Empire. While Grover refused any requests for abdication and full transition to democracy, he was willing to form a parliament like van Cleef proposed, and to implement local democratic rule in the regions of the Empire. When the meeting ended, it was past midnight with both parties satisfied and looking forward to future cooperation."
 imperial.130.a:0 "What a pleasant fellow."
 imperial.131.t:0 "The Separation Of Temples And The State"
 imperial.131.d:0 "His Majesty has decided to continue his reforms which limited the power of the Three Temples. Now he has taken it one step further by passing laws that completely separated the temples from the state, stripping Archons, Prelates and priests of any political power whatsoever in the Empire. This meant reverting most reforms Eros had done, but Grover was determined that this is what he would've wanted.\n\nThe Emperor also integrated the Knights of Arcturius into the Imperial Army, meaning he was now their leader and not the Archon of Arcturius. This removed any military power remaining in the claws of the Archonates and guaranteed that they could not hope to oppose his reforms."
 imperial.131.a:0 "It needed to be done."
 imperial.132.t:0 "The Separation Of Temples And The State"
 imperial.132.d:0 "His Majesty has decided to continue his reforms which limited the power of the Three Temples. However, he has taken a more cautious approach to the matter. The influence of the priesthood has already been diminished due to the actions of former regent Gabriela Eagleclaw, who had a personal grudge with the late Archon of Boreas, Eros VII. Thus it meant that the triarchy's political power was nonexistent, and the many knightly orders who were pledged to archons have been integrated in the Reichsarmee.\n\nNot everygriff was satisfied with this situation, particularly the gods-fearing griffons, and the Emperor has decided to allow the temples to hold limited, if ineffectual power within their area. However, it was made particularly clear that the once influential griffons of faith would never hold considerable any sway within the state's apparatus."
 imperial.132.a:0 "It needed to be done."
 imperial.133.t:0 "Checks And Balances"
 imperial.133.d:0 "To better define the Kaiser's authority and create clear limits for it, His Majesty has formalized a separation of powers in the government. Three separate bodies shall exist: The Emperor himself, the Imperial Parliament, and the courts of law in [GRI.Capital.GetName]. Each branch would have separate responsibilities and powers, and would be capable of keeping the power of the other two in check. No longer could the Emperor pass legislation without approval from a Parliament and the judiciary; neither could the other two do the same if the Emperor were to veto their decision. Thus, balance would be achieved in governance.\n\nGrover VI had given up his near-absolute power, but had also prevented of having the fate of his unfortunate father befall either himself or any of his descendants. The regency council would rule on the Emperor's behalf, but now it would not be able to do anything without getting approval from the Parliament and the courts. Never again would a small number of individuals be able to cause such widespread damage -- which included the Emperor himself."
 imperial.133.a:0 "The Kaiser is not always right."
 imperial.134.t:0 "Freedom For All"
 imperial.134.d:0 "Yesterday across the Empire, crowds formed near the numerous prisons and internment camps which held political prisoners. The crowds primarily consisted of relatives, friends and allies of the prisoners, but also news reporters, curious onlookers and armed guards. They had gathered there to witness the liberation of thousands of political prisoners who had been imprisoned during the reunification wars -- though some had been in prison since the revolution of 978.\n\nWhen the gates opened and flocks of former prisoners finally came pouring out, their loved ones rushed to meet them, and cameras of the reporters flashed constantly, capturing the emotional moments. One example of such a moment was a sixty-year-old veteran NRP member embracing his grandchildren, having been in prison ever since the revolution. Some of the prisoners were, of course, dangerous terrorists, but the guards made sure they would cause no trouble.\n\nThis morning, the frontpages of all newspapers displayed the pictures, most of them praising the Emperor for his mercy and kindess. However, some newspapers such as Campu-Painii Liber of Prywhen criticized the act, especially as the prisons in Prywhen had now released thousands of communist PCP members. They predicted a sharp rise in terrorism and acts of sabotage.\n\nHis Majesty however was confident that his kindness would only be repaid with kindness, and not with violence. No griffon deserved to be imprisoned for their political beliefs or their brave resistance against a despotic regime. If he offered the prisoners what they desired, reforms and freedom, then why would they resist him?"
 imperial.134.a:0 "Hopefully this won't cause any issues."
 imperial.135.t:0 "Liberty For All"
 imperial.135.d:0 "During the regency, the regent had banned all regionalist and nationalist organizations and forced them into hiding in order to curtail organized resistance in occupied regions. Their members were persecuted and suspected of being traitors and rebels who wished to liberate their homelands once more from the Empire.\n\nA while has passed since the reunification was achieved, yet these underground resistance cells continue to exist. Instead of vainly wasting more manpower and resources to hunt them down, Grover VI has instead decided to lift the ban and pardon the members of the organizations. Indeed, they will now be allowed to form proper political parties to advocate for regional autonomy, though independence will remain out of the question.\n\nMost members of these parties have happily welcomed the news, but some most fanatic nationalists, such as Léonard Rodier of Aquileia and Giulio Beakolini of Wingbardy, either remained sceptical or continued to demand full independence. His Majesty believes they too will calm down in time once he passes further reforms."

 imperial.136.t:0 "The Election"
 imperial.136.d:0 "Holding elections for the first time in a country that is used to monarchism and rule by nobility is not easy. Doubly so when the country in question spans half a continent.\n\nIt was a massive operation, with tens of thousands of government officials getting to work, preparing polling booths across the Empire in every single city, town and village. The Emperor had hired several republicans, many of them former prisoners and some even former members of NRP, to offer him and his government advice on how to accomplish the task. Thankfully, the republicans already had plans for a pan-Griffonian election, for it had been their dream for decades. They therefore eagerly helped and soon enough the plans were proceeding on schedule.\n\nWhile the elections were being prepared, candidates began to campaign, trying to attract voters to their cause. This election would decide the make-up of the Imperial Parliament as well as regional assemblies, meaning the campainging was nation-wide. Soon enough, it was clear two parties would dominate the vote: the conservative Kaiserpartei led by Eckhard Wiesner and the liberal Volksfront party of Edwin van Cleef. The former did not want radical change and thought that patience was needed, and also advocated for a powerful Emperor who would keep the parliament and the courts of law in check. They had many religious members among their ranks too and hoped to preserve the power of the clergy to some extent. Primarily, they attracted rural voters who were opposed to radical change but were still loyal to His Majesty. The latter had been an outlawed organization before being legalized by Grover VI, who advocated democratic rule, both nationally and regionally, and wished to further limit the powers of the Emperor, eventually turning it into a ceremonial position. However, they no longer desired a proper republic without a monarch like in the past, either as a gesture of friendship to the Emperor, or because they didn't want to be outlawed again. Young urbanites and workers were their most loyal voters.\n\nNow the day of election has finally arrived, and crowds are filling polling booths, eager to take part in the historical landmark event. The gargantuan task of counting tens of millions of votes began after the booths were closed. But eventually, the results would be revealed."

 imperial.137.d:0 "Soon after Grover's coronation, it seemed like Eros' old age finally caught up to him. When before he had been diligent and determined, now he withered before everyone's eyes, as if he had lost the blessing of Boreas which had kept him alive so long. For a time he acted as Grover's closest advisor, before he eventually suffered another stroke. It was clear to everyone he did not have much longer to live.\nOne day His Majesty decided to pay a visit to his dear mentor and former regent. When Eros, lying in bed, saw him enter, he asked "Grover? Why are you here? You have more important things to do than to visit me, I am sure."\nGrover chuckled and sat beside his bed. "My schedule is actually free, mister Eros. I wanted to see how you're doing, and maybe chat for a while."\n"If you insist," the old griff said and sighed. The two talked for a while, with Grover telling of his reign, and Eros nodding in approval. "You will be remembered fondly by future generations, I am sure," he said. "Unlike me."\nGrover raised an eyebrow. "What do you mean? You're a conqueror who rivals Grover I! It was you who saved the Empire from certain doom, and did everything you could to restore its greatness."\n"I was a zealous tyrant who destroyed nations and reunited Griffonia with iron and blood. I fear what judgement Boreas will pass on me. But remember this, your majesty. All the terrible things I did, I did so you wouldn't have to."\nIt dawned on Grover how Eros had sacrificed everything for the Empire, and for him. He never had a wife, he never had much wealth, and he had given all his vast power to him. Now, the mightiest griffon on Griffonia was but a sickly shadow of his former self. He pouted and clasped the old priest's claw.\n"Eros, if I may be honest... it would pain me if history were to remember you as a terrible person. I know the truth about who you are. You're not a tyrant. You... you're the father I never had. I may not influence the gods, but at the very least I can change the minds of the people. They should look up to you, not hate you."\nEros smiled wearily, and with the little strength he had, grasped Grover's claw. "I appreciate it. But really, don't waste your time on me. I never cared much for earthly reputation. Simply seeing you grow up was all I ever needed in life. And now, my duty is fulfilled. I want nothing else."\nGrover smiled as well. "Fine. How about I just commission a statue of you? I'm sure you'll love it."\nEros let out a chuckle. "If you insist."\nThen Grover embraced him, which caught him by surprise, but he weakly hugged back nevertheless. "I'll come visit again as soon as I am able," Grover promised.\nBut when he came on the following day, the bed was empty. The Archon had joined his father in the heavenly mountains, among fountains of gold."

Grover knew that some reforms were necessary, it is impossible to resist against the flow of time, but as he saw the seeds of a revolution being planted before his very eyes, he knew that tolerating these radicals would be the first step on a long road that would lead to his death. The radicals would bleed the Empire dry through compromise, and once they inevitably grew dissatisfied no matter how much was conceded, they would pounce upon his weakened nation, plunging the continent into an another war.\n\nShould the events of 978 repeat themselves, hundreds of thousands of lives would be sacrificed at the altar of republicanism, as the Griffonian Republic had done all those years ago, achieving naught but death and wanton destruction in the end. The sheer intensity and scale of modern warfare had scarred Griffonia over the past few years, perhaps permanently. And Grover could tolerate the possibility of subjecting his citizens to decades of warfare once more due to his inaction, however slim said chances might be.\n\nThe army would clear out the protesters while he consulted his closest advisors with what reforms would be necessary to keep the empire together. The lives of the few radicals who refused to stand down would be a small price to pay for averting another decade of strife."

The elements of the army chosen for this operation had been specifically selected for their discipline and restraint, as the Kaiser himself had given strict orders that no griffon was to be harmed unless they violently resisted attempts to stop the protests. Griffonia already had enough republican martyrs, and he had no desire to create any more.\n\nWhen the army informed the protesters that their gathering had been declared illegal, the majority of them decided that living to fight another day was far preferable to facing the hardened soldiers of the Reichsarmee that now flooded into the city. Working in conjunction with riot police, the streets of every city in Griffonia where protests had been active were cleaned out, and in a remarkably peaceful manner. A few deaths had been unavoidable, as radical elements of the protestors refused to stand down, but all in all, it was a clean and efficient operation. But such methods cannot sustain an empire forever, and the entire continent waited to see what the Emperor's next action would be."
 imperial.139.a:0 "A fitting lesson if there ever was one."
 imperial.140.t:0 "The Arrests"
 imperial.140.d:0 "After a few days of uneasy peace across the empire since the armed forces forcibly put an end to the protests, the army made its next move. The protests themselves had been primarily organized and led by various student groups across the empire, and over the past few days, the army and police had been tirelessly working to identify the most dangerous groups and individuals amongst them. Once said threats had been identified, the army moved swiftly to arrest and detain them.\n\nUnits of the army surged across the Empire as soon as the order was given, breaking into secret meeting places and houses to round up the leaders of the movement as quickly and efficiently as possible. If even a few were to escape the army, their sway over the protestors would most likely allow them to use the arrests as kindling for the flames of revolution and cause far more trouble than the protests had ever done. But no such future came to pass, as the army managed to arrest every griffon of importance within the movement, leaving the rest of the protestors without any clear leadership to coordinate between the disparate groups that had united for the protests."
 imperial.140.a:0 "A few days in prison will cool their heads."
 imperial.141.t:0 "Muzzling The Press"
 imperial.141.d:0 "The government's reaction to the recent protests had not only created a great deal of unrest within the more liberally minded griffons of the Empire but had also whipped the media into a frenzy. The newspapers and even some radio stations were scrambling to get statements from army personnel and to secure interviews with protesters. As the media's attention became more and more focused on the protests, the message of the protesters was amplified and allowed to spread to millions of griffons outside of the major cities of the Empire, causing a new wave of discontent.\n\nAlthough the Emperor had a degree of tolerance for criticism of himself and the government from the media, the situation had deteriorated to the point where allowing the media to spread whatever falsehoods they liked was inviting disaster. As such, a new Imperial decree has temporarily suspended the freedom of the press, and the state now has final approval of anything put into the newspapers or broadcasts across the airways. The Emperor hoped that, with the spread of subversive information stopped, the message of the protestors would soon be forgotten."
 imperial.141.a:0 "That's one headache dealt with."
 imperial.142.t:0 "The Reforms of Grover VI"
 imperial.142.d:0 "Although the Emperor had no desire to give in to the demands of the protestors, from the very start of the crisis it was clear to him that the Empire would not survive without reform. Continuing from where the previous regent Gabriella left off, his majesty Grover VI announced the dissolution of the council of nobles. Although this was not as large a blow to the power of the nobility as it appeared, with the council being replaced by an advisory body that was, although more inclusive of different social classes than the previous body, still primarily composed of nobles. Despite this, the new council provides the common griffon with much more political representation that the previous arrangement and the news seem to have mostly calmed down the former protesters."
 imperial.142.a:0 "To a safer Empire!"
 imperial.143.t:0 "The Reforms of Grover VI"
 imperial.143.d:0 "Continuing the legacy of the previous regent, Grover VI has passed several reforms broadening the power of the common griffon within the Empire. In conjunction with the Archons, the Emperor has announced that the Archonates would be stepping back from direct governance to allow the representatives of the common griffon more say in the rule of the empire. Citing the impressive progress in moral character and piety the nation has made under the rule of Eros, the future role of the Archonate will be a more advisory one, though if push came to shove they could still have a great deal of influence on legislation, as they have both great sway within the halls of government, and the power to send proposed legislation for review by the emperor himself if they feel it endangers the moral character of the Empire.\n\nAdditionally, a smattering of token reforms put some barriers between the church and the government, granted limited recognition to regional dialects of the official language of the empire, as well as allowing some of the less distasteful religions to practice their beliefs openly."
 imperial.143.a:0 "To a safer Empire!"
 imperial.144.t:0 "The New Kaiserpartei"
 imperial.144.d:0 "The Kaiserpartei has been the nominal controlling party within the Reichstag of the Empire ever since it was established. Despite this, the party itself serves as little more than a rubber-stamping group for legislation pushed by the nobility and the Emperor. Initially formed as an attempt at creating a popular party that would convey the benefits of the Emperors autocratic rule to the citizens of the Empire during the rule of Grover V, the party quickly fell in public opinion, maintaining its majority through a combination of biased voting laws and a few electoral "nudges" from the nobility. But the changing demographics of the Griffonian Empire have rendered the current status quo intolerable, and if if the Kaiser is unable to present a strong democratic front supporting his rule, his position would grow very tenuous with time.\n\nThusly, the Kaiser himself has sent a letter to the leaders of the Kaiserpartei, thanking them for their service, and asking them to step aside and allow the Emperor's preferred candidates to take over the party. The Kaiserpartei itself will refocus on the clear and demonstrable benefits the Kaiser's rule has brought to the Empire, as well as providing intelligent and well-researched counter-arguments to the most common republican screeds that can be found shouted on the streets. With any luck, the Kaiserpartei might be able to make Grover VI the most popular Kaiser the Empire has ever seen, or at the very least make the idea of an armed revolution unpalatable to the republicans."
 imperial.144.a:0 "Reform is coming!"
 imperial.145.t:0 "The Kaiser's Speech"
 imperial.145.d:0 "His Majesty Kaiser Grover VI took to the airwaves for the first time during his reign today, responding to the various criticisms recently laid at his government by the student protestors. The Kaiser expressed his sincere desire to be more connected to his subjects, and to take their desires into account while ruling the Empire, but also stressed the importance of preventing a repeat of the great tragedy that befell the Empire during the revolution. Indeed, the only thing that the republicans had accomplished in the end was spilling the blood of the griffons they claimed to represent, sending a generation to die at the barricades for their refusal to accept the Kaiser's god-given right to rule over all of Griffonia.\n\nThe Kaiser claimed that he would not rule with an iron fist, and promised that further reforms were being worked on, warning his subjects to beware any radicals promising a great deal of change through violent revolution. The Empire would change as it moved into a new era of modernity, but that was no excuse to simply charge forward with reckless abandon. The Kaiser ended his speech by urging his subjects to have patience as the Empire adapted to the challenges it faced in this new era, and by reminding them that progress must always be tempered by restraint, lest the whole Empire unraveled into chaos once more."
 imperial.145.a:0 "Hurrah for the Empire!"
 imperial.146.t:0 "The Reichskanzler"
 imperial.146.d:0 "Eckhard Wiesner, the leader of the Kaiserpartei, has officially assumed the title of Reichskanzler today at the behest of the Emperor. After a long ceremony in which he promised to uphold the laws and principles of the Empire to the highest degree and a personal oath of loyalty to the Emperor himself. Although it was not done through an election as many would have liked, many griffons are nevertheless happy that the Emperor has chosen to delegate some of his powers to a representative of an ostensibly democratic party. Though Eckhard is unlikely to challenge the Emperor on any of his commandments, he would do his very best to advise the Emperor on how to better accommodate the wishes of his subjects, and how to use his great power to the greatest benefit of the Empire.\n\nEckhard was not one to waste time, however, and immediately after his appointment ceremony had finished, he set out to accomplish the program of limited reform that the Kaiserparty espoused. To achieve a balance between the newly made democratic institutions of the Empire and the absolute authority of the Kaiser."
 imperial.146.a:0 "We are certain he will do a great job."
 imperial.147.t:0 "Controlled Opposition"
 imperial.147.d:0 "As the Kaiserpartei now possesses a majority within the Reichstag, and with the position of Reichskanzler firmly in the hands of their leader, there is little that the other parties could do to challenge their power. But despite the Emperor's preference for autocratic rule, he knew that the illusion of a democratic opposition to his rule had to be maintained at the very least, and there is no better opposition than one you control. A few choice bribes here, a few grants of land there, and suddenly the leaders of the opposing parties within the Reichstag were very accepting of his suggestions. Not to say that he completely dominated their agendas, that would be pointless, but the more radical elements of their programs would be scaled back. Slowly moving the idea of a fully republican Empire from a serious idea to be discussed, to a radically unthinkable proposal that no griffon in their right mind would espouse.\n\nManaging the Empire would certainly be easier if his opponents wasted their time debating with the Kaiserpartei within the Reichstag instead of organizing against him. Sometimes, he would even let them propose legislation that the Kaiserpartei would work into a more reasonable form to be implemented. Allowing the opposition a few irrelevant victories would be a fine way of dispersing their anger."
 imperial.147.a:0 "Useful tools."
 imperial.148.t:0 "Freedom For Most"
 imperial.148.d:0 "As the Griffonian Empire expanded, it was inevitable that vast amounts of soldiers and political dissidents would be imprisoned due to the extreme ideological differences between the Empire and the wider continent. Many had expected that these prisoners would languish in imprisonment for years before being released, and their status was especially controversial in the areas the Empire had most recently reconquered. But in a rather surprising announcement, the Emperor himself declared that the time had come for Empire to heal the wounds that had driven it apart for so many years, and that he would be granting those guilty of lesser crimes against the Empire a pardon for their actions. A few days later, the largest release of prisoners in the entire history of the Empire, and perhaps the world, occurred. The worst offenders would be kept incarcerated, of course, there was no need to endanger the populace by letting too many communists out after all.\n\nAlthough this limited release might have disappointed some of the more hardline progressives within the Empire, for most it was a chance to reunite with loved ones that had been missing in the Imperial prison system for years, or even decades. The day of the release was marked with celebrations across the Empire, and the Emperor himself delivered a speech on the radio, reminding the newly released criminals that his kindness was not infinite and that he would not be so generous to any who abused his kindness to return to a life of sedition and crime.

In fact, it seems they have been fortifying their positions and preparing for war.

 grover.1.t:0 "Meeting the Emperor"
 grover.1.d:0 ""Grover, my child, could you please come out from your room?", the newly minted regent of the Empire, Gabriela Eagleclaw pleaded once again to the closed door. It was a grand success of politics to have come this far, for sure, and the look on Eros' face was priceless, but Gabriela now had a more personal conundrum to deal with. The young Emperor must be protected from things he could not truly understand yet.\n\n"Where is d-daddy? I want my daddy back!", the young Grover sobbed in his chambers. Gabriela could have easily gotten the door opened, but she didn't want to force the poor chick. She had to be motherly. "Grover, I will explain everything if you allow me to come inside. I promise it will be better.", she spoke calmly and slowly.\n\nThe little scheme was a success, and the doorway slowly opened. Gabriela did not have a moment to observe the insides before she was pounced on by her weeping nephew. Quickly, she embraced Grover and placed a claw on his head, comforting as best as she knew. "Mo- A-auntie Gaby? Why can't daddy come back? He was okay some time ago..."\n\nNogriff relished the experience of death, Gabriela thought inwardly. "My dear nephew... Your father was strong, and wise, but... he is in a better place now. Which means you are the Emperor now. And I will be your regent."\n"Re-ject? What is that?"\n"It means I will be handling your more difficult duties until you grow up, and become a proper adult. Your father would have wanted this. He was a very dear friend to me, too."\n"Okay... but I still miss daddy."\n"We all do, but we cannot spend all day crying. There is much work left to be done. Would you like to come with me to the throne room?"\nThe little Emperor's eyes brightened at the mention of the throne room. Gabriela knew he was very fond of the rich decorations.\n"A-alright. I think I am ready to go now."\n"Very good, my child. Make yourself presentable and we'll get going.""
 grover.1.a:0 "You're in safe claws now, little Grover."
 
 grover.2.t:0 "The Emperor's Education"
 grover.2.d:0 "Gabriela patiently stood in the hallway in front of the dressing room, waiting for her nephew and future Emperor to emerge. Already the time has come for young Grover to begin his studies. He was slightly forlorn about losing his free time, but accepted with surprising maturity the responsibilities he would be subjected towards. Gabriela felt very attached to Grover, and felt disappointed in herself that she did not yet have children of her own. If they were precocious and adorable like her nephew, she'd find a husband immediately! Unfortunately, very few could meet her expectations. Before she could continue her train of thought, the door opened and Grover stepped out.\n\n"Ah, your majesty. You look quite satisfactory in your uniform.", Gabriela complimented, hoping to reduce the nervousness she knew Grover felt.\n"It's rather uncomfortable, auntie. Do I have to wear it?", Grover pleaded and stretched the collar of his shirt.\n"Clothes make the griffon, dear nephew. I assure you that in good time, you'll get used to them very much. Now, have you taken all the materials I told you to prepare?"\n"Yes, auntie. I am ready.", he retorted meekly.\n"Very good, my child. Now then, you should know that I have brought the finest tutors from Readewetter to teach you everything you'll need to know, such as history, arts, etiquette, rulership, economics, faith and more. Of course, you'll be given a proper pace so you don't feel burdened, but make no mistake, your studies are very important.", Gabriela finished her speech.\n"I know, aunt Gaby. But... won't you teach me too?", the young Emperor implored.\n\nThose small words struck Gabriela's heart more than she wanted to admit. If it were possible, she would educate her nephew by herself, but lately all sorts of distractions and responsibilities cut into the already small amount of time she could spare for Grover. He was, of course, quite capable being on his own, but no child should bear the weight of absent parents.\n"I... When my schedule is free, I will make time for you, my child. I promise." She spoke earnestly, hugging her nephew. He didn't respond after that, taking his time to appreciate Gabriela's motherly embrace.\n"Alright, dear nephew. We don't want you to be late for your first class, yes?"\n"No, auntie. I will go now.", and with that, the future Emperor departed in the opposite direction. Gabriela continued standing for a while, smiling at the increasingly smaller figure of her nephew. He shall make us all proud, she knew this."
 grover.2.a:0 "His potential is limitless."
 
 grover.3.t:0 "Mischief of Youth"
 grover.3.d:0 "Gabriela was delighted to have a private dinner with her dear nephew. Responsibilities and stress have only piled up, and she was aching for these little moments of respite. Had she known that ruling a vast state, much larger than her fiefdom, entailed this much paperwork, perhaps she'd consider giving Eros a chance. Of course, none of that would happen, and the peers' rights will be secured. Taking a careful bite of the Macawian watermelon slice, she turned her attention to the young Emperor, who seemed a little distraught.\n"My child, how are your studies? Are you progressing well?"\n"Uhh, yes, auntie. Everything is fine.", Grover responded rather unconvincingly, fiddling with his dessert. Gabriela might not have children of her own, but she could tell when someone was being evasive. Still, he was young and could be excused, but such habits must be excised before they would become troublesome.\n"Your grace, you remember our talk we had about falsehoods?"\n"I, I... yes, auntie. I remember. It's just that... I don't want to disappoint you.", he spoke in a low, embarrassed tone. "M-Mister Longbeak has caught me sleeping at his class. I can explain."\n\nGabriela did not expect such a thing. At worst, she'd consider that her nephew was pulling pranks, but this seemed rather innocuous. "Nephew dearest, are you having troubles sleeping? I hope you're not having nightmares again."\n"No, auntie. Last week, when I was at the Palace Library, I borrowed a copy of "Bygone Griffons of Greatness". It was so interesting, I could read it all night!", he cowered a little when he saw his aunt's disapproving gaze, "Not that I did that or anything... but the lives of the past Emperors are so fascinating, I wondered how could I be as great like my ancestors. And to be honest, mister Longbeak's class is rather boring.", Grover finished quietly while swallowing the last piece of his Aquileian chocolate éclair.\n\nGabriela pondered for a while on this knowledge. While sleeping during class was certainly a bad habit, the fact that the young Emperor showed such interest in history suggested a certain cleverness that his friends didn't share. Thus she made her decision.\n"Grover, you will not be disciplined. However, you will make up for what you missed, on your new class." He stared in confusion. "I think that you're ready to begin studying history. Mister Longbeak's services will not be required anymore for the time being, but I don't want to hear again that you're being tardy, alright?"\n"I-Yes, auntie! I won't let you down!""
 grover.3.a:0 "There's no wrong in admitting."

 grover.4.d:0 "Grover had a keen feeling something was amiss today. There was nogriff to greet him after he exited his chambers, and the guards were missing, as well. He checked neighbouring rooms for any occupants, to no avail. For a moment he thought that when he wished for everygriff to disappear, it came true, but ultimately dismissed it as ridiculous. Passing next to the deserted Imperial Throne room, Grover went for the banquet hall. Surely, there would be at least something to eat if nogriff is around? Pushing the wide double doors outward, he did not expect what happened afterward.\n\n"HAPPY BIRTHDAY, GROVER!"\n\nThe young Emperor went slack jawed at the spectacle. There was auntie Gabriela, many of his teachers, and even the palace servants! Many of them held wrapped presents in the claws, with smiles on their faces. He couldn't remember the last time he received so many congratulations! Rushing to hug his aunt, he beamed at her: "Aunt Gaby! What is this all about?", he asked in astonishment.\n"It is your tenth birthday, my dear nephew.", she retorted, stepping aside to show a mouthwatering chocolate cake with many strawberries from Strawberry Duchy, and ten candles waiting to be extinguished. "We've all gathered here to wish you the very best, and celebrate in style this momentous occasion. Now, go ahead and make a wish.", nudging him towards the table.\nOf course! How could Grover forget about his birthday? Thus he went forward, and blew the candles out. His wish would have to wait, for a more opportune time. Afterward, he spent many hours mingling with other griffons, who waited in a line just to give the Emperor a token gift and best wishes. The row of griffons seemingly never ended, as more and more arrived with each hour, important figures in the Empire, as well as his friends.\nFinally, once everygriff has left the banquet hall, Grover could have a seat and enjoy a slice of the exquisite cake with his only close family member.\n"I didn't think there would be so many guests, auntie. Am I really that important?"\n"Of course you are, my child. As the future Emperor of us all, many will seek to court your favour. It is up to you to determine whose pledges are genuine, and whom are merely plotting to use you for their ends. You'll learn in time, however."\nGrover knew that being an Emperor wouldn't be simple, but there was still so much to master. Still, he felt confident that he could make it. He was given everything he needed, and his aunt made sure nogriff could harm him.\n"I will be the best Emperor there was, auntie. I won't let you down.""

 grover.5.d:0 "Gabriela was pleased to hear of the newest Imperial conquest. Another upstart, insolent pretender crushed, another territory returned to the rightful Imperial rule. Now the bureaucrats would move in to administer the region as the garrison kept order, but the matter remained of knights who were taken as prisoners of war. Traditionally, their fate would be determined by the Emperor, but with the current circumstances, young Grover would simply read a previously written decision. Everything would be simple and proper.\n\nThe Imperial Throne Room saw a bustle of activity, as the prisoners were brought in before the Emperor, awaiting their fate. Gabriela had to admit, her nephew may have only begun growing up, but already he seemed like a true ideal of a ruler. The captives didn't seem to be too enthusiastic as Grover recited a speech written by his aunt, and looked desperate enough to try to escape, if it weren't for the numerous guards. Soon, their sentences would be rendered, and Maar would decide their punishment in the afterlife.\n\n"...by the powers of Boreas, Eyr and Arcturius, I, the august Emperor Grover, declare you to be conscripted for Our service, and should your loyalties stand true, your holdings shall be returned and preserved for ages to come."\n\nGabriela blinked in confusion, as her train of thoughts derailed. This wasn't how she instructed her nephew! Even the knights seemed rather surprised as they issued their pledges, soon after taken away by the Palace Guards. She had to speak with Grover, but carefully. Surely, he had a good reason for acting on his own, as Gabriela approached the throne.\n"Your grace, why have you commanded them to your service? You know their fidelity is suspect, and could rebel as soon as they are left to their own machinations." The young Emperor set aside the heavy crown before responding: "We cannot always be heavy clawed on our subjects, auntie. They have done wrong, yes, but I believe they can be redeemed. We'll keep an eye on them, but if we show that we can be merciful, perhaps others will see fit to submit instead of fighting. Nogriffon has to die."\n\nGabriela was astounded by this mature outlook. Certainly, she wasn't happy sending soldiers to their deaths, nor introducing rationing among the citizens, but they had a duty to help restore the Empire proper. Just as she remembered in her young days.\n"Your wisdom is notable, my dear nephew. I can only hope that we can avoid unnecessary bloodshed.""

Sometimes she bemoaned her claws-on approach, but the state was her primary concern. Once Grover was old enough, and that day was rapidly approaching, he would have a stable nation, and there won't be a repeat of 978. Only then could Gabriela enjoy her well earned retirement. After ascertaining his location from a passing servant, she made her way to the Palace Gardens, where a most unexpected occasion was taking place.\n\nThere stood the young Emperor, holding claws with a griffoness. Gabriela narrowed her eyes at this... intruder. Certainly, her bearing and outfit suggested a noble upbringing, but the way she looked at her nephew suggested a more ignoble goal. This had to be broken up before anything official occurred. Making her way past the carefully trimmed hedges, she was quickly noticed by the pair.\n"Auntie Gaby! You have to meet my companion, she is the daughter of the baron of..."\nBut the Duchess gave little heed to what Grover was saying. She gave this little trollop, with her insincere smile and grabbing claws, her most scornful gaze, the one she was fond of using on uppity aristocrats who were getting a bit too self-indulgent. It didn't take long for the would-be Empress to make quick excuses and depart. Gabriela did not enjoy her victory for long before her nephew demanded answers.\n"Auntie, why did you do that? She wasn't harming me, we were just talking!", Grover complained with anger behind his words.\n"Grover, my child, you know I care for you more than anything else. I've lived long enough, and saw more than you can imagine. She was just using you for her own goals, no doubt on the instructions of her family. Many would sell their firstborn just so they could be related to the ruling family, and my intention was only to protect you."\n"I wasn't going to let myself be used, auntie! I'm not a child anymore!"\n"I have no doubts of your intelligence, nephew. But you must be aware that in these circles, even a suggestion of courtship could be taken the wrong way. You'll find a fine partner some day, no doubt, but now you are still vulnerable.", she moved in to place a claw on his shoulder.\n\nGrover pondered on these words for a while. "I understand, auntie. I just miss my friends, and the loneliness gets overwhelming at times."\n"It's never easy being at the top, Grover. This is something you'll have to handle on your own.""

Soon enough he would take up the rein and chain of commanding, and she would watch from afar, in peaceful retirement, as Grover would rule justly and secure a bright future for all griffons, even for the ones who had some seditious thoughts. But before that day would come, Gabriela still had some lessons to share.\n\n"Auntie, I regularly attend the temple services, I already know about the Triarchy."\n"I am not claiming you are ignorant, my dear child, but some things should be learned from an... unbiased perspective." Gabriela briefly pondered on her old nemesis, Eros. It gave her such satisfaction to have replaced him with a much less temperamental griffon. "I know many priests and they're fine and upstanding griffons, but they can get rather blindsided when it comes to piety. Now, tell me what you know about the Triarchy."\n\nGrover seemed bored as he recited: "Boreas, Eyr and Arcturius created the griffons and blessed them with intelligence, strength, wisdom and physical forms. Maar, the eternal deceiver, attempted to corrupt the griffons, but was cast down before he could accomplish his fiendish task. Afterward, the gods remained in the heavens ever after, and their word is spread by the priesthood. The priests are led by prelates, which are in turn led by archons. Archons are chosen by a secret ritual known only to the few."\n"You've been very meticulous, my nephew, but some things have been obscured from you. For example, many griffons pay fealty to local deities, such as Eviliana and Sycaecia. Others gather in heretical cults that spread violence and nonsense, like the followers of Maar. But there is a grain of truth in their proselytising. Minor deities are just as worth celebrating, and Maar had a crucial role in creating griffons that most overlook. Of course, one can never be sure what is true about the mythical."\n\nGrover listened with rapt attention to Gabriela's words. He didn't think often about questioning his betters on their knowledge, but it seems that the larger picture is often obscured. "It was most intriguing, auntie."\n"When you formally ascend to the throne, dear Grover, you'll have much to pay attention to. Always be vigilant.""

All those months of planning and work would finally pay off.\n\nThe grand door opened, and a maid entered, holding the claw of the young Emperor and leading him inside, to his new Regent. Eros smiled and looked down on the small griffon, who glanced back at him shyly.\n"Grover, meet the Archon. He will be your new regent," the maid said. Grover remained silent.\n"Do you know what a regent is, child?" Eros asked with the warm voice of a wise grandpa. Grover shook his head in response.\n"You see, you're the Emperor, a big boss who gets to tell everyone what to do. But you are too young yet. While you grow up, study and play, I will be ordering others around and taking care of unexciting paperwork. How does that sound?"\nGrover frowned. "My daddy was Emperor. Where is daddy, old bird?"\nEros' smile faded away. How would he explain death to a four-year-old?\n"Your father... he's with Boreas now. Among golden fountains in the heavenly mountains, walking in the gardens of Eyr along with his ancestors, testing his newfound strength by sparring with Arcturius. So he cannot be Emperor now. He trusts me and you to do his duty from now on."\nGrover's eyes were wide open in amazement. "Old bird, can you tell me more about that Boreas?"\nEros smiled again. "Of course, young Grover.

Already he showed innate abilities as a leader: His friends listened to him and he listened to them, and they trusted him fully. Perhaps one day they would be ready to die by his side.\n\n"Your majesty, come here," Eros beckoned. Grover ran up to him, his friends not far behind.\n"What is it, mister Eros?" he asked, panting.\n"I would like you to meet your tutors. Remember, your studies begin tomorrow."\n"B-but mister Eros, we were going to play hide and seek—"\n"No buts, young griffon. Now come, they are waiting for you, and their time is valuable."\n\nGrover bid farewell to his friends and followed his regent inside. There, two griffons stood.\n"Your majesty, meet Erion, Archon of Eyr. He will train your mind by teaching you theology, writing, grammar, mathematics and more."\nErion sneered. "You better not fall asleep during my classes, child. I will use my beating stick, Emperor or not."\nEros rolled his eyes and turned to the other griffon. "And this is Proteus, Archon of Arcturius. He will train your body and teach you martial arts, military science, marksmanship and more."\nProteus strongly grasped Grover's claw and shook it vigorously. "Pleasure to meet you, my Emperor! I will turn you into a true son of Arcturius!" Grover winced and pulled away his squished claw.\nEros looked at the young Emperor. "These two will be your primary educators whenever they have time. There will be other tutors as well. They all have your best in mind and want to give you the finest possible education. Do you understand?"\nGrover nodded silently.\n"Good. Like I said, your studies begin tomorrow. Now go play with your friends while you still can."\n"But we can play later too, mister Eros?"\n"I'm afraid you will need to focus on your studies. But perhaps if you study well, your teachers will be generous."\n"I will do my best, mister Eros, so I can play as much hide and seek as I want!" Grover exclaimed.\nEros smiled.

 grover.10.d:0 ""Grover, where did you go?" Proteus called in the empty hallways, his voice echoing as he searched for the young emperor. Behind the corner, Grover quietly slid inside a janitor closet and closed the door. All of his muscles were aching after the sparring session, and he sighed tiredly. He turned on the electric light and took out a book and a bar of Grover IV's famed chocolate from his bag. He then sat down, put on his glasses, and opened the thick book. It was called "Bygone Griffons of Greatness", but out of all the great conquerors and kings, he found his ancestor, Grover I, to be by far the most interesting. He seemed almost divine in his perfection and glory.\n\nThe door opened with a creak. Startled, Grover looked up and saw the janitor starting at him. "Y-your majesty?" she asked in confustion. "Aren't you supposed to be sparring with Archon Proteus?"\n"I can explain! Just don't tell anyone!" Grover pleaded.\n\nHalf an hour later he was in the sparring room, his head hung low from shame and tears in his eyes. Proteus shook his head in disappointment. The other Archons finally entered and Proteus greeted them. "I am glad you could come. Grover here was skipping from my sparring class! I do not know what to do with him."\nErion sneered. "I knew it. The child lacks discipline. Eros, you should've let me use my beating stick!"\n"Silence!" Eros barked, and Erion whimpered. "I will take care of this myself. You two, leave us alone." Erion nodded fearfully and scurried away, while Proteus bowed respectfully and left as well. As soon as the door closed, Eros' expression softened. He kneeled down next to Grover. "Tell me, child, why did you do this?"\n"I-I don't like sparring," he explained. "I'm bad at it and I never get better at it, no matter how hard Proteus tries. Same with fencing. W-what's the point, even? Everyone uses guns nowadays."\nEros sighed. "The point of this exercise isn't to make you a good fighter, it's to keep you physically fit and healthy, so you don't end up like your father. Why didn't you tell Proteus you don't like it?"\n"B-because I have to get good at everything. So I can be like Grover I."\nEros chuckled. "Your majesty, no Grover was ever perfect. Not even Grover I. If you're hopeless at close combat, you can train something else. Say, how does archery sound?"\nGrover lifted his gaze. "Archery? That... sounds good. I can try that."\n"Very well.

While it was his birthday, he still expected to have a class or two in the morning before celebrations would begin. As he was sorting his quills and pens, the door behind him opened. It was Eros, and he had a stern look on his face. "Grover. Come to my office. Now." He left without saying more. Grover stood in shock for a moment. What had he done this time? He gulped and left his room, slowly and hesitantly walking towards the office. Eros was already inside waiting for him. He took a deep breath and entered.\n\n"Surprise!" a dozen griffons shouted. The room had been decorated for a party and a huge chocolate cake was on Eros' desk, with two large candles shaped like the numbers one and zero. Eros smiled. "Fooled you. Happy tenth birthday, Grover." Sons and daughters of the servants and maids, his friends, ran up to him and congratulated more. Grover laughed, then turned to Eros. "Does this mean I don't have to study today"?\nEros shook his head. "No. This birthday is a special one. Feel free to play hide and seek with your friends."\n"Hah. I'm too old for that. I'd rather show off my archery skills. But first, cake!"\n\nHours later, the sun was setting and a weary Grover headed back to his room. Eros greeted him as he passed by. "I hope you enjoyed this day. Reaching the age of ten is a major milestone on the way to adulthood, and is worth celebrating."\n"I very much did, thank you mister Eros." He smiled for a moment, but then frowned. "But... it will still be eight years before I can become Emperor. It feels like such a long time. What if I end up like my dad?"\n"Your father's regents were nobles, who only cared for their own power and wealth. We priests have no need for wordly vanities."\n"What if you say I'm not ready and don't let me become Emperor when I'm eighteen, like the nobles did?"\nEros chuckled and let out a sickly cough. "My dear Grover, chances are I won't be alive by then. And even then, I would never deny your divine right to rule."\n"What of the other Archons?"\n"I swear to you, if any of them stand in your way, by Boreas I will rise from the dead and strangle them personally."\nGrover remained silent for a moment.

The older he got, the more often he appeared in public, but security measures remained strict. Every building along the way had been emptied and was guarded by Imperial Knights. But Grover did not feel anxious. Only a little shy, but also happy about his subjects and their adoration of him. Though in the back of his mind, he suspected they only loved him because of the spoils of war that were being presented in the parade. He glanced behind him, at trucks carrying hundreds of prisoners of war, foreigners from distant lands. Unlike the crowd, they were silent and downcast. He also thought how after the parade, the citizens would get back to work overtime in military factories, churning out weapons for his army.\n\nGrover returned to his home at the Palace with no incidences. Eros was there to greet him, almost proud that Grover had led a parade without him. While he smiled, Grover frowned, and wished to ask a question. The Archon was happy to answer.\n"Mister Eros, I know you are leading the army to many wars to reunite my father's Empire. But... is it worth all the suffering it causes?"\nEros' smile faded and he pondered silently for a moment. "A good and mature question. All this warmongering is indeed difficult to understand if you are young. But an old griffon like me remembers the good old days, before the Idol of Boreas was lost and everything fell apart. Back then, there was stability and prosperity among all of griffonkind."\n"So you want to relive the glory days of the Empire?"\nEros shook his head and placed his claw on Grover's shoulder. "No. I'll be dead before I can do that. I want you and your subjects to experience such a golden age."\nGrover smiled faintly for a moment. "Still... is it really worthwhile?"\n"Is the pain and toil of life worthwhile? Yes, as long as you are righteous and believe in the Gods, for they will reward you with paradise. So too will the reunification of the Empire be worth everything, as long as we believe in it."\nThe young Emperor nodded slowly, and wondered what life had been like when Eros was twelve like him.

The chick looked around the courtyard in amazement, her eyes wide. "Wow, this place is even fancier from the inside! Such wonderful statues and fountains and gardens. Almost looks as good as you do," she said with a giggle.\nGrover smiled warmly and held her claw. "Maybe one day you'll get to live here too. I'm willing to give anything to you."\n"Anything? Even like... a fabulous new car? And a dress decorated with diamonds?"\n"Anything," Grover swore with determination.\n\nHe opened the door and entered inside, but stopped when he saw Eros, leaning on a walking cane, waiting for him and frowning. "E-Eros? I thought you'd be asleep by now!"\n"Grover, we need to talk. In private," he said, and turned to look scornfully at the griffoness, who hid behind the Emperor. "Begone, harlot! You do not belong here."\nAfter the initial shock, Grover boldly stepped forth. "Don't talk to her like that!" he shouted. Eros remained silent and glared at the chick.\n"Sweetie, I should leave. See you tomorrow," she said meekly, gave him a quick peck and left. Before Grover could say anything, Eros began to drag him along to his room, with surprising strength in his old arms.\n\n"Why did you do that?" Grover exclaimed, his high-pitched voice cracking. "Now she'll be too afraid to ever come here!"\n"You do not need her. She doesn't truly love you. You're too young to realize it, but she's after your wealth and prestige, nothing else."\n"Well I am old enough to decide who I spend my time with!"\n"Listen here, Grover. Do not give in to your desires. Your forefathers specifically avoided having more than one child to prevent succession wars. Because of this, the Empire has never been torn asunder by dynastic bickering."\n"It fell apart all the same," he mumbled.\n"No, the Empire still stands, and I am making sure it will remain so. Trust me, Grover, Eyr will ensure that one day you will find a partner who truly loves you. Someone who will stand by your side no matter what. Look in your heart and you will know that she is not that griffon."\nGrover remained humbly silent and gazed at the floor. "I... I suppose you're right. But she's so beautiful.

Grover smiled and admired how diligent he still was, despite being a frail bird who was over a hundred years old at this point. He turned to leave, worried that he'd be late from class.\n\nA loud thump came from the office. A chill went down Grover's spine and he stopped for a moment, before dropping his books on the floor and rushing inside. Eros had fallen on the floor from his chair. He seemed unconscious. Without hesitation, he immediately called for aid and went to revive the poor old griffon. His heart was still beating, but his claws were cold and he did not wake up, despite Grover's best attempts.\n\nThe courtly doctors examined Eros and concluded that he had suffered a mild stroke and fallen into a coma. They were unsure if he would wake up, and predicted he'd most likely die within days. The Imperial court soon erupted into chaos, with no one being entirely sure who was in charge now, and the other two Archons did their best to restore order. Grover did not let grief and worry overcome him and boldly stepped forth, saying he would rule in Eros' stead before he'd wake up. Despite him being under-aged, the Archons agreed to let him help them at the very least.\n\nWhile the expectations were low, Grover impressed everyone when he confidently began to fulfill Eros' duties, such as performing religious rituals, filling paperwork, issuing commands to the chief of staff, holding speeches, drafting legislation and meeting foreign dignitaries. He was shy and avoided confrontation, his vast knowledge made up for it.\n\nA week later a miracle occurred and Eros woke up from his coma.

It would be impolite to keep your betters waiting, family or not, as Gabriela opened the ornate doors to the Emperor's room.\n\n"Auntie!

Ever since that climactic day, where the score ended up being a 6-6 tie the two teams have vowed to defeat the other.\n\nThe roster for both teams was considered phenomenal today, with many promising newcomers on both sides. Many expected that today's game would finally bring an end to the streak of stalemates that have plagued the two teams, as each team has yet to beat the other.\n\nAlas, it seems that today was not the day, with the match result ultimately being declared null and void by the referee. The problems started just 8 minutes in when the Yellowjackets managed to score an early goal against the Fowls. This early setback caused the Fowls to panic, and a few minutes later one of their star players, Herman Mudbeak, was disqualified after it was declared that picking up the ball and flying it into the other team's goal was not a legitimate move.\n\nThis string of setbacks continued to plague the fowls for the rest of the game, and finally came to a head just a scant 7 minutes from the end of the game, 4-2 in the Yellowjackets favor. It was then that the unconscious bodies of several prominent members of the Fowls were discovered. This lead to the unmasking of 3 changelings which had apparently infiltrated the Fowls in an attempt to sabotage their efforts. The stadium then erupted into a brawl between the supporters of the two teams, while the Yellowjackets and Fowls quickly left the scene.\n\nWhile this might be the most controversial match between the two teams yet, it is far from the last as a rematch has already been scheduled, with many eager fans pre-ordering their tickets as soon as the announcement came, although the Yellowjackets will be sporting an all-new team after the previous members were shot by their guards upon returning to their hotels."

While this would normally not be a problem, as establishing strong ties with foreign allies is an important part of being Emperor, the gift itself was highly... unusual.\n\nWhile an exotic pet or expensive treasures might have been anticipated as gifts, what was not expected was a fully functioning Panzerkampfwagen VI Tiger, decorated in the imperial colors. While this unorthodox gift was not a problem in itself, it seems that somebody forgot to secure the keys to the tank. The Emperor soon showed up, dragging the top tank aces of the Empire with him, and demanded that he be put into the driver's seat.\n\nWhat followed was an impromptu crash course on tank command, as the Emperor set out into the countryside along with his crew, only returning after a massive griffonhunt had been started. On a positive note, it seems that the young Emperor showed skill as a tank commander, and has displayed interest in increasing funding to the Imperial Committee for Armored Research and Development, demanding another tank for his next birthday."

 grover.18.d:0 "The Imperial director for internal security was not a happy griffon. He rarely was, as the imperial capital is a hotbed of assassinations, plots to overthrow the government and foreign spies, and as such his position was not an enviable one. But today was proving to be particularly difficult. As he sat in his office questioning a new hire about the recent debacle in the capital.\n\nApparently, the problems had started earlier that morning when gunfire could be audibly heard from one of the many abandoned buildings in the outskirts of the capital. After a team was sent to investigate the site was discovered empty, save for hundreds of bullet casings. Strangely enough, it seemed that both sides had used guns of the same make. It was not long after that an undercover officer reported in, stating that during his infiltration into one of the many banking cabals that control the capital he had been part of the events that morning.\n\nIt seems that during a meeting with the other members, they encountered changeling spies, who had apparently decided to utilize the same building as a meeting spot. What followed was a short gunfight before the two sides realized that, as per their weapons, they worked for the same employer, and promptly stopped shooting at each other.\n\nSaid employer was in actuality a front set up by the ministry of internal security and was apparently supposed to provide insight into the criminal world of Griffenheim.\n\nThis had come as a surprise to the director, as he had no records of ever supplying any changelings through that particular front. He ultimately chalked it up to the bureaucratic nightmare that is the capital, but it seemed that somehow he was responsible. In the end, only one decision was made. Whatever he did, he sure as hell wasn't about to do it again."

It seemed that despite all the hustle and bustle of the city, the Griffons still valued their slow mornings, and as such, they tended to become quite alarmed when something out of the ordinary happened. That is exactly what happened that morning, as an Equestrian tourist ran desperately through the streets.\n\n"THEY ARE COMING, RUN, RUN EVERYPONY, RUN FOR YOUR LIVES"\n\nTheir screams echoed throughout the massive streets of the capital and caused quite a stir. Mistakenly many assumed that the treacherous communists had staged an uprising, or that a Wingbardian commando group had been sent to assassinate the Emperor.\n\nAs the Pony ran through the streets, they eventually reached the imperial palace, where they claimed to have information on a grave security threat. After eventually screaming their way in, they forced themselves into the imperial meeting room to speak to, or more likely scream at, the regent.\n\nBut as they opened the doors to the meeting room, the pony fainted out of shock and left the regent and changeling ambassador, which the regent had been meeting with, quite shocked. After recovering, the pony claimed that they had spotted changelings readying to attack and that they could be disguised as anyone, of course, this all happened in front of the changeling ambassador.\n\nThe pony was shortly escorted out and told to be more tolerant and friendly to other races."

 grover.20.d:0 "When Bronzekreuz was announced to be the first destination of Grover V's imperial tour on the new Imperial Railway System, the administration of Count Ignatius scrambled to organize the grandest welcome festival. Delegations from all corners of the County were invited to greet him and offer him gifts. A new contingent of recruits for the Barkginian guards were readied to be officially presented to and reviewed by their beloved emperor. Furthermore, tens of thousands of simple citizens travelled to Bronzekreuz to see the emperor.\n\nWhen the emperor arrived in his train, he was greeted by crowds around the train tracks for miles, organized in small groups of enthusiastic citizens or in stands. The Emperor Grover II Station was covered in banners and floral decorations and Count Ignatius personally welcomed him when he came out of his train. The Count was shocked to see his beloved emperor looking frail and tired but nevertheless, he warmly greeted him before kneeling. Grover smiled and personally helped him stand up before embracing him. Those near the two could hear the emperor say "Thank you, my friend". The ceremony continued with a small recital on the station's plaza with a chorus of puppies singing the Oath of Loyalty. Then, the emperor retired himself to his private residence at Houndsor Palace where he rested before attending a private feast in his honor.\n\nThe next day saw several changes in the planned events as the Emperor preferred to preserve his energy for the long journey ahead and therefore did not attend hunts and balls. The announcement caused some disappointment among the nobility and population but many praised the emperor for being so thoughtful towards his subjects at large. The emperor did, however, host several private audiences to personally receive the many delegations bringing gifts to him, warmly thanking each and every one of them.\n\nWhen time came for Grover to leave, he stopped before embarking on his train and turned towards Ignatius. Everydog looked at him, expecting him to speak and noticing that he seemed somewhat sad. Yet, he said nothing and simply embraced Ignatius before leaving."

He was on tour of his empire to show his splendour and - although fragile - health and complete grasp over the throne. "For as long as I shall live", he thought, as he disembarked from the train to enter a carriage surrounded by a chanting crowd of courtiers and citizens. He was off to see the Duchess.\n\nGrover was announced by a chamberlain in lace cuffs. ‘His Imperial Majesty the Emperor Grover the Fifth'. He entered the large room pierced in its south side by great windows looking over the gardens; it was magnificent, as he remembered it. Duchess Gabriela Eagleclaw stood up and looked at him, beautiful as she ever was. "I take it you have come here to apologize", she said with a stern voice. "Whatever for?" He answered as she came facing him, closer and closer. "For not coming here sooner". They stared intensely into each other's eyes in a long and difficult silence, until they both burst out laughing. He took her in his arms. "Cousin. How I have longed to seeing you. You are right, it was long overdue".\n\nThey took place around a small table where tea had been arranged. "What is this? Is it... By Eyr, strawberries in winter?" He exclaimed, looking at the small tarts elegantly disposed on a silver tray. Gabriela laughed. "Surprise! My gardeners engineered it two winters ago. After all, this duchy goes after its name." They spent the afternoon laughing and reminiscing about the past, their fledgling games in the gardens of Readewetter, the first balls in Griffenheim, all those happy years until the loss of the Idol and the revolution.\n\nAfter dinner, they still hadn't mentioned his state affairs or hers. "You know I don't think... I don't... Maybe this is... The last." He said, clutching his brandy in his claws, looking down into the glass. The fireplace was crackling quietly in front of their comfortable chairs. She looked at him with a face of deep understanding and regret, yet still smiling tenderly. "Don't mention these things. I'll follow you into the depths of the valley of shadows, my emperor. However later, perhaps. But I'll guard you nonetheless." She kissed him on the forehead."

 grover.22.d:0 "Emperor Grover V was on a tour of the Empire by train, visiting all of his vassals. He was welcomed in De Vleugels Central Station by a massive crowd of enthusiastic Feathisians, many waving Imperial and Feathisian flags. The Grand Duke's motorcade then drove the Emperor to the Weijermars family manor, perched on a hill overlooking the Feathisian city. There Gerlach had dinner with his old friend. Grover V looked exhausted and a bit pale, but it seemed the quiet of the manor did him well. The Grand Duke had a simple meal prepared, which would normally be considered a faux-pas.\n\nBefore the food arrived Gerlach started to talk. "Your Majesty," the Grand Duke said, his voice betraying the warm affection he felt for his friend, "how is your son, has he grown since I last saw him?"\n\n"Yes, Gerlach, he will be taller than me, Gods willing!" The Emperor's voice had gained in strength since his arrival, but Gerlach could sense Grover did not want to appear weak in front of him. He was sick again.\n\n"The people are looking forward to seeing you two together on your next-"\n\n"No, Gerlach." Grover stared at his friend and the Grand Duke could for a moment see the truth in his eyes. He was dying!\n\n"But the Empire! Grover, you have to keep going! What will we do without you? Please..." The Grand Duke's protests trailed off into quiet resignation. He looked down, his knife shaking in his claw.\n\nThe Emperor changed subjects. "You should have proposed to her, that night, at the ball. She would have said yes." Grover could only be talking about one griffon, Gabriela Eagleclaw.\n\n"I wouldn't have had the time for her, I would have..." The ruler of Feathisia gave the usual excuses, which he knew would not convince his friend.\n\n The Emperor's gaze lingered determinedly upon the Grand Duke, as if backed by divine authority. "Gerlach, don't take your regrets with you to the afterlife. If anything, don't do that."\n\nThe conversation was ended by a servant bringing the food. The two griffons then dined in silence."

 grover.23.d:0 "It was a cold and misty morning when the train arrived at the river marking the border between the Grand Duchy of Feathisia and Greifenmarschen. The train had to slow down as it was about to cross the bridge due to the fog. The sound of squeaking brakes mixed with the sound of the roaring engine, fading away when the train safely reached the other bank.\n\nFrom there it wouldn't take long to Oldwingburg. As they grew closer, houses and homesteads began to be visible from the train car's window. Some of them very small and simple while others were bigger, perhaps housing several families and domestic animals. Eventually, the city came into view and the train started to slow down as they were nearing the new railway station built at the edge of the city.\n\nWhen the train arrived at the station, they were welcomed by a crowd of cheering griffons. The station behind them stood out almost as an anomaly, its modern style clashing with the city that looked as if it could have existed at the time of the first Grover. It was decorated with standards and ornaments bearing imperial colours. Within the station, a great clock imported from Yale was adorned with the imperial flag on top of the flag of Grieffenmarschen.\n\nUpon exiting the car, his majesty was welcomed with another loud cheer from his subjects. The crowd was composed of citizens of all 'marches'. [Root.GetLeader], leader of the peasant council, then officially welcomed Grover V. After that, peasants dressed in traditional regional garbs offered his majesty products of their hard work, freshly baked bread from local grain along with salt, fruit and vegetables nicely arranged into a basket, and local sausage meat for him to taste. It may not have been luxurious but they were all the hallmarks of the peasant Republic which helped feed the empire.\n\nAround noon, council members showed his majesty the city. The sun had decided to show up and dispersed the fog, making the day much more pleasant. His majesty seemed a bit tired at times and needed to take short breaks along the way. Members of his entourage suggested skipping the rest of the tour. However, his majesty assured them it was fine. The tour ended in the local Temple of Boreas which dominated the city. Architecturally, it may not have been as splendid as the temples of Griffenheim but his majesty took time to pray there with his subjects nonetheless.\n\nThe day ended at city square where locals prepared a festival in his majesty's name, performing local songs, dances and tales. However, the emperor declined to dance and excused himself early in the evening. The following day, the population came in large crowds to see his majesty leaving and as the train began moving again, his majesty waved back to his subjects before a fit of coughing forced him to disappear inside the train."

 grover.24.d:0 "Snow was falling over the Free City of Romau as the Imperial Train bellowed, its smoke tainting the white snow blanketing the countryside. Grover looked out of the window, feeling tired. The last few days had taken its toll on him. Jumping around from place to place, even if it was good to see his old friends again. But for now, it was back to what lay ahead.\n\nAs he looked out of the windows on the train, he looked down into the new Empire. Romau was unlike many of the other places in the Empire. Factories that were still a marvel in his younger days were now all around the ancient cities, their chimneys blowing out smoke. As they grew near, passing through some industrial areas, he could sense tension in the air. The industrial quarters offered little to the eye but squalor and the rickety trees planted around the train tracks added to the misery instead of hiding it. He saw angry crowds and at one point, a bottle came smashing into the train, causing the emperor to jump from his seat. Grover shook it off, however, as the train left the industrial area and began to pull into the station.\n\nAt the station, a mixed reception awaited the Emperor as he disembarked; Archon Erion XII with his entourage stood alongside senators led by the old Ravioli, who were flanked by citizen delegations from the whole city.\n\n"Welcome your Majesty! I trust the trip went well?" The Archon asked, seemingly eager to meet the Emperor.\n\nGrover only nodded, shivering from the cold, the hardship of the trip tearing at his body and mind. Grover turned, his attention caught by distant yells, unmistakably from protesters.\n\n"Pay no attention to the rabble! They have proven to be the complaining type lately. I half-expect them to blame us for the snow!" The Archon said awkwardly.\n\nGrover remained still and simply acquiesced. It was no time to embarrass the Romauans further. Duty called, after all, even if the duty was irritatingly smug. The Archon kept droning on, not noticing the Emperor dozing off before him. At least, he would only be there for a day...\n\n"-But you simply must come with me, your Majesty. I am sure that you will find Romau quite interesting.""

The noise of the train was drowned out by the cheers of the railway workers and engineers who had gathered inside to see their Emperor arrive. This wasn't the first visit of Grover V, who had made the Imperial Railway a pet project of his. Rector Magnificus Mikusian, along with the head railway-engineer, greeted Grover when he stepped out of his carriage. The Emperor looked sick and weak, and it almost seemed like each step was taking its toll on him. Mikusian gulped as he shook the claw of the Emperor. It was that bad.\n\nThe head engineer seemed to not care, still smiling proudly as he greeted Grover. He asked the question on everygriffon's mind, "Your Majesty, how was your trip so far?"\n\nTo the surprise of all, Grover smiled and answered, "Your team did an excellent job. You managed to cut through some of the harshest terrain in the Heartlands and some of the views were astonishing." The crowd exploded into cheers and even Mikusian managed to relax for a minute to listen to Grover speak. The Emperor continued his praise, "Any griffon who rides this railway, will surely feel as close to every part of the Empire as I have. Thank you for-" The Emperor started coughing loudly, "Thank you for the-" Grover's head bowed down as the fit of coughs continued.\n\nThe crowd fell silent again and Mikusian decided to step in and shield the Emperor. "Let's go inside, it must just be the pollution."\n\nOnce Grover was safely seated in his carriage again, the Rector Magnificus appealed to him. "Greenback has the best hospital on the continent. Perhaps you could stay here. Whatever it is, it isn't too late to-"\n\n"No, Mikusian. I must continue. I must finish this trip."\n\n"Your Majesty. . ."\n\n"They need to see me one last time. Maybe you will understand that, someday."\n\nMikusian fell silent. How could Grover still carry on? What drove him?

Instead, the Emperor had a pleasant conversation with Großmarschall Othmar Stoiber.

As the train pulled in, it was greeted by a giddy Diellza von Katerinburg and a fervently cheering crowd (encouraged by armed police to express their suitable reverence for the emperor).\n\nYet as it would turn out, Grover did not come out of the train, instead only appearing in the window, waving to the gathered griffons as Diellza was invited inside by two armed knights. Inside the car, the Princess was faced with a pale and worn Grover, who sat heavily in his seat and invited her to sit down. Diellza, who had worshipped the Emperor ever since he reclaimed the throne and in her mind punished the revolutionaries, sat quietly down in front of him. They shared a brief semi-conversation, Diellza being too busy listening in silence to Grover as he spoke to make for much of a conversationalist, and after a few minutes Grover told her he had to depart due to his health, but that he wished her well.\n\nAfter merely five minutes, the Emperor's state visit was over, and Diellza was left standing at the station staring in silence after the departing train, too stunned to do much of anything, even as the staff quietly dispersed the crowd before she could explode in rage at anyone."

 GRI_arantigos_reborn_desc:0 "The citizens of Arantiga have started to act strangely these past few weeks. It seems that they have convinced themselves that the Lord Protector is Arantigos reborn. While normally such foolishness would be stamped out, the Lord Protector has, after giving serious thought to the idea, decided to embrace it as fact. Is there anyone which can deny that his conquests do not surpass those of Arantigos?"
 GRI_falcorian_legion:0 "The Conquest of Asterion"
 GRI_falcorian_legion_desc:0 "The minotaurs of Asterion have never truly accepted the authority of the Empire, and have continued to resist our rightful rule for generations.

 GRI_reichkomissariats_desc:0 "Managing the Riverlands is an extremely taxing endeavour, and it is proving to be more of a headache than it is worth. By allowing some measure of autonomy, we can at the very least throw this problem over at some other griffon."

 GRI_hear_them_out:0 "Hear Them Out"
 GRI_hear_them_out_desc:0 "The protesters are right, radical reform is needed now that the Empire has been reunited. The bloated military-industrial complex and wartime quotas have no reason to exist, and the loyal subjects of the Empire deserve to have their voices heard."
 GRI_recall_the_troops:0 "Recall The Reichsarmee"
 GRI_recall_the_troops_desc:0 "Ever since the protests began the army has been on standby, preparing to step in if any signs of an imminent revolution were to appear. The patrolling soldiers and army vehicles have made our subjects rather uneasy, so now the Emperor has decided to order them to return to their barracks."
 GRI_talk_with_the_students:0 "Talk With The Leaders"
 GRI_talk_with_the_students_desc:0 "While the protests started without much organization, the students have flocked behind prominent reformists and democrats with political experience. Many of them were once our enemies, but perhaps reconciliation is in order so we can live together in peace."
 GRI_allow_independent_press:0 "Allow Coverage"
 GRI_allow_independent_press_desc:0 "So far there has been strict censorship on the news coverage of the protests, both domestically and abroad. This allows for vicious rumours to spread, some even claiming that innocent civilians are being gunned down in Griffenheim. These lies can only be stopped by revealing the truth to all."
 GRI_the_promise:0 "For A Better Tomorrow"
 GRI_the_promise_desc:0 "The protests remain calm and there is no threat of revolution. Yet nevertheless His Majesty plans to accept most of the demands of the student movement. His motive is not to end the resistance, but to reform the Empire into a more democratic nation that genuinely cares for its subjects."
 GRI_support_conservative_parties:0 "Support The Volksfront"
 GRI_support_conservative_parties_desc:0 "The Volksfront has for some years now been a banned political organization, whose members were hounded as republican sympathisers and traitors. Now His Majesty has decided to lift the ban and pardon the members of the party, because the only "crime" they committed was advocating liberty."
 GRI_seperation_of_church_and_state:0 "Separate Temples And The State"
 GRI_seperation_of_church_and_state_desc:0 "The influence of the Archonate of Boreas has always been strong in Griffenheim, but this influence kept growing until the line between the Three Temples and the Empire itself became blurry. The Emperor has decreed that this must change, so religious authorities become humble servants of the people."
 GRI_limiting_the_monarchy:0 "Defining The Kaiser's Authority"
 GRI_limiting_the_monarchy_desc:0 "Ever since Grover I, the Emperor's authority was assumed to be absolute or non-existent, depending on the Emperor.

 GRI_release_moderate_leaders:0 "Forgive And Forget"
 GRI_release_moderate_leaders_desc:0 "After the revolution of 978, thousands of political prisoners have languished in detention, and the Imperial reunification only swelled this number with countless prisoners of war and resistance members.

 GRI_permit_regional_parties_desc:0 "The regent was determined from the very beginning to make the Empire far more centralized than it had been before, refusing to allow nations such as the Kingdom of Aquileia and the Kingdom of Wingbardy to even exist. But the Emperor says there is no need to be so extreme, and that regionalists aren't rebels but loyal subjects who simply desire more autonomy."
 GRI_article_of_federalisation:0 "The Article Of Federalisation"
 GRI_article_of_federalisation_desc:0 "The Empire is too vast to be a unitary, oppressive state. Power must be dispersed from the capital into the numerous regions of the Empire to a reasonable extent. This way every griffon will have their voice heard, either by a local governor or by the Emperor himself, no matter how far away from the capital they live."
 GRI_finalise_the_constitution:0 "The Imperial Constitution"
 GRI_finalise_the_constitution_desc:0 "The Emperor desires to go one step further from simply defining the limits of his powers.

It will also introduce something truly groundbreaking: Universal suffrage for all citizens."
 GRI_the_election:0 "The First Election"
 GRI_the_election_desc:0 "Many in the world cannot believe it to be true: The Empire is preparing to hold its first democratic elections. Not only will a parliament be formed, but local governors will be voted for as well. The conflict between the former liberal Republic and the authoritarian Empire has come to an end, as they have now become one and the same."
 
 GRI_demilitarise_the_economy:0 "Demilitarise The Economy"
 GRI_demilitarise_the_economy_desc:0 "The reunification is over. There is no longer a constant need for thousands of rifles and millions of bullets. The largest conflicts have been fought, and the people have suffered long enough from war-time rationing and quotas. The Emperor has officially decreed that the Imperial economy must be returned under civilian control as soon as possible."
 GRI_limit_conscription_term:0 "Cap Conscription Terms"
 GRI_limit_conscription_term_desc:0 "During the reunification wars, there was no definite limit on the length of conscription for citizens. While this enabled us to have a large pool of griffonpower to draw from, it did mean that a large portion of the populace was forced to serve in the army for a long time. Now a formal limit of 5 years of service shall be universally introduced."
 GRI_abolish_conscription:0 "Abolish Conscription"
 GRI_abolish_conscription_desc:0 "To get enough griffonpower for the reunification wars, the Empire had no choice but to force its able-bodied citizens to serve in the army. Now there is no need for such oppression and coercion, and the Empire's population is so vast that volunteers alone could fill the ranks of the army. Therefore His Majesty has decided to end conscription for now."
 GRI_ensure_free_trade:0 "Ensure Free Trade"
 GRI_ensure_free_trade_desc:0 "Securing strategic resources by limiting exports and trying our best to make our enemies not prosper by refusing to trade with them was reasonable before. Now, when our enemies are few and our economy is demilitarizing, it is no longer justified. Emperor Grover VI wishes to tear down all barriers on commerce, which will further boost civilian economy."
 GRI_welfare_for_all:0 "A Caring State"
 GRI_welfare_for_all_desc:0 "The Empire has caused a tremendous amount of suffering and loss of life with the reunification wars. Now it is time to pay back our moral debt and give back to those we have taken from. With increased revenue from a revived civilian economy, we can afford to support those less fortunate in our society, and make sure all our subjects live better lives."
 GRI_the_autobahn:0 "The Kaiserliche Autobahn"
 GRI_the_autobahn_desc:0 "The only accomplishment of Grover V was a railway network connecting most of Herzland. Grover VI wishes to continue in his paw steps except on a much grander scale: a concrete motorway intended for automobiles, which are becoming increasingly common. It will connect every city and town of the vast Empire, but will be worth every Idol spent on it."
 GRI_securing_the_future:0 "Securing The Future"
 GRI_securing_the_future_desc:0 "Imperial education during the regency served two purposes: Eradication of illiteracy and indoctrination of our subjects. Neither are no longer needed. An extensive reform of the curriculum will liberalize the arts and sciences. The students, who used to protest on the streets, will be grateful as we will allow them to think for themselves."
 GRI_back_to_normal:0 "A New Empire For A New Age"
 GRI_back_to_normal_desc:0 "The Emperor has reshaped his Empire as he desired, and solved the crisis that threatened to end his reign before it had even truly begun.

 GRI_send_in_the_tanks_desc:0 "These "protesters" are nothing but a potential repeat of 978, possibly paid for by foreign influences who bemoan the resurgent state of our glorious Empire. Having legitimate concerns is acceptable, but attempting to undermine the Emperor's authority is not. It is clear that only force will disperse this rabble."
 GRI_mass_crackdowns:0 "Mass Crackdowns"
 GRI_mass_crackdowns_desc:0 "This infestation is worse than we thought. It is not just occuring in Griffenheim, but across the entire Empire! Their numbers grow by the day, and their demands are becoming increasingly radical and unacceptable. The Reichsarmee will have to be mobilised to handle this issue, as quickly as possible."
 GRI_arrest_the_students:0 "Arrest The Students"
 GRI_arrest_the_students_desc:0 "Emboldened by seditious philosophies, these students who were supposed to be our bright future, that would inherit the order we've fought so bitterly to restore, have turned their back on the Emperor. No doubt they conspire with Republican remnants, or worse. Everycreature who has been involved in this protest must be investigated thoroughly to determine their true motivations."
 GRI_muzzle_the_press:0 "Muzzle The Press"
 GRI_muzzle_the_press_desc:0 "The newspapers and radio broadcasts are spreading wild hysteria with their biased reporting, showing us as tyrannical murderers of children while the protesters are being whitewashed and absolved of their crimes. Free speech is a dangerously radical policy that could convince the gullible masses to rise up in revolt. We have no choice but to silence the rabblerousing journalists and promote those who remain loyal."
 GRI_the_emperor_of_griffonkind:0 "The Once And Future Kaiser Of Griffonkind"
 GRI_the_emperor_of_griffonkind_desc:0 "In spite of everything, tension remains palpable and unrest could very likely continue. The Emperor has decided, after long consultation with his advisers, to implement token reforms that will quell most of the moderate protesters, while ensuring that power remains centralised within the Emperor himself. The line of Grover, of the purest blood and most noble griffon qualities, shall lead us now and forever."
 GRI_reform_imperial_party:0 "Reform The Kaiserpartei"
 GRI_reform_imperial_party_desc:0 "Grover V's reign saw an attempt to establish an imperial political party dedicated to furthering the cause and idea of monarchism and autocratic rule outside of the traditional methods of court politics. The attempt fell through but we can learn from their mistakes and build a new and successful Kaiserpartei. Even in upholding tradition, one must learn to use innovative methods."
 GRI_reaffirm_emperors_role:0 "Reaffirm The Kaiser's Role"
 GRI_reaffirm_emperors_role_desc:0 "Although the Empire can be proud of its long tradition and just laws, there are some issues that remain unresolved because they were never strictly codified. One of them would be the legal definition of the Emperor's authority, which has varied depending on the ruler and circumstances. To prevent any future misunderstandings or disasters, it will have to be put to the paper."
 GRI_attract_detractors:0 "Convince The Detractors"
 GRI_attract_detractors_desc:0 "Even among those who support the Emperor, there are dissidents. Their grievances are not severe enough to merit punishment, but the Kaiserpartei must project an image of strength and unity. Favours and concessions would be enough to secure their allegiance, while rooting out any ideas of disobedience."
 GRI_appoint_a_PM:0 "The New Reichskanzler"
 GRI_appoint_a_PM_desc:0 "The storm is passing and now that we have crushed those foolish cries for democracy, it is time to appoint an official head of government. Many protesters called for such an appointment but we will do so on our own terms and the new Reichskanzler will serve only at the discretion of the Emperor."
 GRI_bribe_the_oppossition:0 "Controlled Opposition"
 GRI_bribe_the_oppossition_desc:0 "Money changes griffons, this is known. The Emperor's authority cannot be undermined, but a paid opposition, which will give the public an appearance of checks and balances, is the next step in bringing the Empire to a new age. We are certain that the "opposition" will be smart enough to read what we give them, and not attempt to propose radical ideas. Best not to bite the claw that feeds them, after all."
 GRI_local_collborators:0 "Permit Regionalism"
 GRI_local_collborators_desc:0 "Even with the modern communication technology we have, the Empire's domains are vast, which means that responses to events are not always as quick as we'd like. However, if we permit regions that are known to be pacified certain autonomies, it would make administering our realm much more straightforward. We are prepared for the protests that will inevitably spring from the troublesome provinces."
 GRI_calculated_releases:0 "Release The Prisoners"
 GRI_calculated_releases_desc:0 "Not all griffons who were imprisoned for inciting insurrection are harbouring true guilt. Some were simply at the wrong place at the wrong time, or were misblamed by their opportunistic enemies. By releasing those whose crimes are non-existent or minuscule, we shall garner the public's goodwill, while the real malcontents remain imprisoned until they repent for their misdeeds."
 GRI_draft_a_constitution:0 "Draft A Constitution"
 GRI_draft_a_constitution_desc:0 "Ever since Grover I acquired the Idol of Boreas and formed our Empire, the function of the state has always been organized through various custom,  limited laws, precedents and the Emperor's character. It is time to synthesise the spirit of all these old rules and formalize the Griffonian Way of ruling into a constitution. It shall rest on the pillars of Autocracy, Faith and the Griffonian National Spirit."
 
 ### Ideas ###
 GRI_bureaucracy:0 "부풀어오른 관료주의"
 GRI_bureaucracy_desc:0 "After years of neglect, failure to modernise and general corruption, the Imperial bureaucratic system has become a bloated abomination. It is not unusual to wait a full month just to get an audience with a bureaucrat. That bureaucrat then redirects you to another one so you can file several forms that in the end turn out to be unnecessary."

 ### Advisors ###
 archon_proteus:0 "집정관 프로테우스 3세"
 archon_erion:0 "집정관 에리온 12세"
 archon_erion_desc:0 "Youngest of the three Archons, born in 959, Erion XII has risen rapidly through the ranks of the Eyrite Temple to the very top. However, this was not achieved by exceptional piety alone, nor by hard and honest work. Erion is ever hungry for more power and is not afraid to use more questionable and violent means to gain it. Now that he has achieved supremacy in the Archonate of Eyr itself, he seeks to grow his temporal power as well.\n\nAll this has made Erion rather unpopular among the nobility and the clergy, who see him as a threat and a lunatic. The hatred is mutual, as Erion often rants about the corruption of the nobles of Griffonia and the senators of Romau, and the incompetence and lack of zealotry of the priesthood. Many commoners are swayed by his fiery and passionate speeches, especially among the lower classes. Erion's control of education contributes to this as young students are indoctrinated and turned into faithful servants of Eyr.\n\nWhile Erion is power-hungry, none can deny he is a devout Eyrite as well. His parents, poor industrial workers in Romau, were very religious and conservative, and sent all their children to a temple school. There, the eyes of their youngest child, Lorenz Whitefeather, were opened and he became a faithful servant of Eyr, the goddess of fertility and family. After becoming an Archon, Lorenz chose the archonal name of Erion. Even to this day, Erion sends money to his old parents, and preaches the importance of traditional values.\n\nErion has a tenuous relationship with his fellow Archons of the Borean and Arcturian temples. As Eros is one of the most influential griffons in Heartlands, Erion always seeks to impress him and earn his favour, so Eros would entrust him with more power. Eros sees through his act, however, but sees him as a useful if dangerous pawn. Proteus on the other claw openly distrusts and dislikes Erion, and Erion despises him in return for his lack of piety and neglect of clerical duty. The two only work together because they must."

 ### Country leader descriptions ###
 grover_v_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 26th March 960 in Griffenheim\n\n§YBiography§!: Nominally the Emperor of all Griffonia, Grover V has had a difficult life. Never the most healthy of griffons, he has lost his father to a stroke, and with that, woe soon came to the Empire. The loss of the Idol of Boreas, the Republican Uprising of 978, millions of dead griffons - Grover could only watch and weep as the events unfolded. Nonetheless, the Emperor could count on his good friends, notably Archon Eros VII and Duchess Gabriela Eagleclaw, to keep him safe from the worst and guide him in ruling what remained of loyalists. An unifying force for the Heartlands, Grover has developed a sense of grim determination and does his best to maintain the Empire's legacy, regardless of his personal issues.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
 eros_vii_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 9th December 914 in Griffenheim\n\n§YBiography§!: One of the oldest living griffons, Archon Eros VII was born when the Empire was at the height of its power. At a young age, he joined the priesthood of Boreas out of genuine respect for the Gods. His pious devotion and humble manner has led him to quickly rise to the position of Archon, and all seemed well. Yet cruel fate had in store to render the Empire asunder, with the loss of the Idol of Boreas and the incompetent Council of Regents dragging the country to the ground. He was responsible for saving the young Grover V's life from the claws of Republican insurgents, and has maintained a close friendship with him ever since. This is why he protects the late Emperor's son, Grover VI, and hopes that once his regency is over, he will rule an unified Empire. Yet Eros has little love for the nobility of the Empire, believing them to be responsible for every misfortune that has plagued the Heartlands. And now, with the broad support of the commonfolk, Eros and his fellow Archons are attempting the restore the Empire's glory. The traitors and unbelievers will pay with their blood, Boreas wills it!\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

Her charisma and force of personality, not to mention her sizable personal properties and wealth, has placed her in a position where she can command most of the petty lords. She has always championed for the cause of her peers, but she is not blind to the plight of the common griffon and wishes to introduce limited reforms to the system, genuinely wishing for the people to have a good life, proud of their country. All she does, she does it in honour of her friend, the late Emperor, and holds in contempt the Archons, believing that they'll ruin the country with their dangerously radical ideas. Until the Emperor's son is old enough to ascend to the throne, Gabriela balances her many responsibilities and leads the Empire to a new dawn.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
 
 ### General Descriptions ###
 GRI_elias_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 23rd of July, 939 in Landstal\n\n§YRank§!: Generalfeldmarschall\n\n§YBiography§!: Elias Bronzetail was born in Landstal as the youngest of eight children of the oil entrepreneur Ernst Bronzetail and Aquileian socialite Yvette Pierrat. In 957 the young Elias finished his secondary education, but with no hope of ever inheriting his father's business he chose to become an army cadet at the prestigious Groverianische Reich Militärakademie in Helheim.\n\nIn spite of some initial hurdles Elias quickly proved himself an adept strategist and a masterful if rather stubborn planner. While his blunt demeanour and oftentimes mirthless attitude did not exactly earn him many friends, he nevertheless managed to find a sense of camaraderie and some would say friendship with fellow cadet Erich Ebonwing: who like Elias himself would go on to earn the rank of Generalfeldmarschall.\n\nElias began to steadily climb the Reichsarmee hierarchy, which was frequently dominated by nobility. However, Elias would only truly earn a place in the eyes of the Empire at-large during the Republican Revolution of 978; the constant delays his troops caused the Republicans proved to be crucial in allowing the Loyalist forces to regroup, and his victory over General Reinhard Suntail at the Battle of Crona in 979 earned him the rank of Generaloberst. In 991 Elias finally achieved the rank of Generalfeldmarschall due to both his skill and his many years of service\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Echo"
 GRI_erich_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 27th of September, 938 in Crona\n\n§YRank§!: Generalfeldmarschall\n\n§YBiography§!: Erich Ebonwing was born in Crona as the eldest and only child of the affluent Baron Germund Ebonwing and Rhea Steinheil; the daughter of a merchant from Ravensburg. The young Erich spent his youth in abjact luxury - partying and drinking his days away, caring little for his studies. Thus it came as a surprise to both his friends and his family when he chose to attend the Groverianische Reich Militärakademie in Helheim.\n\nEbonwing would to the surprise of many prove himself a capable officer, a resourceful leader and a fierce combatant - All of these factors coupled with his natural charisma and force of personality managed to win him the respect of many of his peers, the most notable of which was the usually mirthless Elias Bronzetail.\n\nDue to his noble background Erich was able to advance his career rapidly. However, it would be during the Republican Revolution of 978 when Ebonwing truly showed his prowess as a military commander. Beating the Republicans at the Battles of Vinnin, Gamia and Osnabeak the young Oberst quickly became a media darling and a living propaganda tool, in spite of his prowess he could not stop the so called 'Rape of Crona' an event that affected him deeply. Thus, it came as no surprise that when the Republicans were finally chased out of Griffenheim in 979 that it was Ebonwing who gave chase. Chasing them from Griffenheim to Brenna, Ebonwing would have more than likely contiuned hounding the Revolutionaries all the way to Cloudbury had he and his troops not been recalled back to Griffenheim in order to assist in restoring order to the Imperial Heartlands.\n\nFor his actions during the Revolution Ebonwing would much like his friend and comrade Elias be promoted; first to the rank of Generaloberst in 981, and finally to the rank of Generalfeldmarschall in 996\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
 GRI_ferdinand_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 10th of March, 965 in Griffenheim\n\n§YRank§!: Oberstleutnant\n\n§YBiography§!: Ferdinand Dawnclaw was born in the slums of Griffenheim. A sickly and weak albino, whoever his parents were had simply opted to leave the young griffon in the care of the Arcturian Archonate.\n\nThis decision would not only save Ferdinand's life, but ultimately, propel him to greatness, as it was precisely due to his upbringing within the Arcturian priesthood that he was able to flourish into the formidable griffon he is today.\n\nIn spite of his sickly disposition, Ferdinand's priestly caretakers quickly noticed the young griffon's sharp mind and eye for detail; talents which they quickly chose to cultivate. By 978, Ferdinand was well on his way to becoming an Arcturian priest, and he might well have become one had a simple event not occurred - The Republican Revolution.\n\nIt was the Revolution that gave Dawnclaw his first taste of war, and while he was too young to join the Reichsarmee or even assist in the fighting, he found himself so enamoured by the violence that when he finally finished his studies in 983, he chose to attend the Reich Militärakademie in Vinnin rather than be ordained as an Arcturian Priest.\n\nAfter graduating from Vinnin in 987, Ferdinand steadily rose through the ranks of the Reichsarmee, managing to attain the rank of Oberstleutnant in 1004 via a battlefield promotion in a skirmish at the Feathisian-Cloudsburian border - the murky circumstances of which many within the Imperial General Staff have found rather confusing.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Echo"
 GRI_august_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 17th of December, 962 in Ravensburg\n\n§YRank§!: Oberst\n\n§YBiography§!: August Duskwing, Oberst in the Imperial Army, born in Ravensburg in 962 to a group of working-class parents originally seemed destined for a life in as many others in his neighborhood was cut out for. Long hours in the factory and on and on until he was to die some point. However, as time marched on, he turned out to be decidedly not that, having been involved with numerous petty crimes during his time.\n\nThis would, once the law caught up to him, be the start of his rather strange way up the ladder to a command position. Originally destined for the infantry, which seemed to be a certain death sentence, he instead became one of the first to join the Sturmtruppen or the ‘Dare-to-die' Corps as it was called in military circles. He gained a probably not healthy reputation for always charging into the enemy lines as the first, earning him several battlefield promotions as his superiors either retired or died. Usually the latter. Stories about him are popular material both in the Imperial newspapers and in the military rumour mill, with at least a few being true such as him refusing sedation during surgery.\n\nNevertheless, in later years, he has been known in the Imperial Officer Corps as one of the foremost proponents of the Superior Firepower doctrine and has called for its implementation.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Richmay"
 GRI_ancietus_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 18th of October, 959 in Griffenheim\n\n§YRank§!: Oberstleutnant\n\n§YBiography§!: Anicetus Mudbeak, born the only son to a family with a long line of service to the Emperor in Griffenheim in 959 grew up repressed. Whatever he dreamt of, from architect and trader to politician and his chief interest, engineering was all shot down by his parents in their intense desire to see the family legacy continued. In other words, forced into the military at age 16, far away from the books and bridges he had enjoyed before, and even farther away from the engineering battalions.\n\nWhile slowly climbing the ranks in the Kaiserliche Armee, he turned to the bottle as a way to cope with his quashed hope and dreams for the future, and slowly sank into a depression. It would take the Revolution to wake him up, as he arranged the finer mechanics of the Second Battle of Griffenheim, getting the improvised bridges quickly up to permit the artillery bombardment of the Republican positions.\n\nHowever, this did not come without cost, as he was wounded by artillery shrapnel during the last few hours of the battle. This led to an even worse habit as he became addicted to the cocaine provided to him, along with other substances. Since then, he has mainly been idling in his office, counting the time until he can retire with a big pension to return to his first passion.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup/Sesek"

 GRI_cecilia_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 4th of July, 971 in Vanguardigo\n\n§YRank§!: Major\n\n§YBiography§!: Cecilia Marshtail was born in the hills of Vanguardigo as the only child of Count Gaspard Marshtail and Armelle Aubert; the last scion of the venerable Aubert family that had ruled Meshiro for centuries. Young Cecilia was destined to live a life of luxury and wealth, but fate decided otherwise; As in 980 the famed Aquileian Revolution began. The Revolution would see both of her parents beheaded, and the then nine year old griffoness spirited away into the forested hills of Orvalillo by a group of loyal retainers.\n\nAnd so, the young Countess would live in the forest, safe from the chaos that had consumed her homeland, and although her parents were dead, her retainers nevertheless did everything in their power to ensure that Cecilia had at least some semblance of a normal childhood. She was given a basic education but also learned how to live off the land and hunt. This would continue until Marshal Berthelot's Counter-Revolution in 985, at which point Cecilia would at long last return to civilisation.\n\nWhile her title and lands were returned to her, the wealth and power that were tied to it were not as the Discret used the situation to consolidate power away from the traditional nobility. By 989 Cecilia would enroll in the prestigious Écoles des Beaux-Arts in Rila, where she would in turn briefly join the MPA which she left a month later after deciding that they were nothing but fools and upstarts. Thoroughly dissatisfied with both the Discrets and the Republicans, Cecilia concluded that Aquileia had only truly been great while it had been under the Griffonian Empire and would end up forming the Impératrice Giselda Society, which sought to restore Imperial hegemony over Aquileia.\n\nThe Impératrice Giselda Society would quickly be suppressed by the Discrets and Cecilia forced into hiding once more. After being sentenced to death (in absentia) for high treason in 1000, she would once again return to the forests of Orvalillo where she and what few compatriots she had; From there, she began a guerilla campaign against both the Discrets and the Republicans rebel groups. Although she received little to no material support from the Empire, she very quickly became an Imperial Media Darling after an article about the Impératrice Giselda Society was published in 1004, something that would earn her the at the time honourary rank of Major and a commendation from Archon Proteus. After being forced to evacuate Orvalillo and by extension Aquileia in 1005, Cecilia would at long last formally join the Reichsarmee.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Cofido"
 GRI_arnold_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 11th of Feburary, 953 in Soldau\n\n§YRank§!: Generalmajor\n\n§YBiography§!: The son of a Hellquilian Baker from Soldau, Scheer's family moved West into the Herzlands when he was young, so as to find better opportunity and get out of Hellquill - ultimately a good idea, if the political landscape was anything to go by.\n\nScheer grew up reasonably well off for his family's standing, and finished both his primary and secondary education, spending a short term as a teacher in his new home city of Helheim. He quickly grew listless, however, and found that he was not overly fond of small children, and so began to look for other opportunities. On the word of a friend of the family, Arnold enlisted into the Kaiser Groverakademie Officer Candidate School on a whim, able to pay his own way with a mix of personal funds and saved funds given by his family.\n\nHe quickly butted heads with his then rival, Cornello Galluzzo, who held little regard for the bookish Scheer, and the two held little love for each other through most of their Officer's training, eventually fostering a healthy respect for each other by the time they'd graduated the course. They wouldn't be legitimate friends until the year 978, however, with the advent of the Republican Revolution in the Griffon Empire. During the Civil War, Scheer put his bookish nature to great use, and made a name for himself as an excellent Logistician, able to "magic up supplies from thin air," as one officer remarked. Due to his efforts, the Monarchist army was able to remain supplied, even when it was thought next to impossible, and raised himself to local hero status when he was able to deliver supplies four miles past enemy lines to the surrounded but easily holding forces of Cornello Galluzzo- which incidentally, made the two fast friends. Galluzzo, who'd been waging an unconventional guerilla warfare style of combat in the thick Scheisswald forest, denies that he'd ever needed resupply, but more than readily thanks Scheer, even to this day.\n\nFor his fantastic logistical abilities, Scheer was elevated to General staff, and by 1006, had achieved the rank of Majorgenerall. Though he has no current field command, he instead has the unenviable task of managing the Imperial Army's logistics and supply channels.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Echo"
 GRI_cornelio_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 29th of May, 956 in Talont\n\n§YRank§!: Oberst\n\n§YBiography§!: Born to a pair of blacksmiths in Talont, Wingbardy, Cornello grew up poor. The young griffon, however, found himself quite smitten with the outdoors, finding himself at home in the mountains and forests of his homeland. As he grew up, he found little to no interest in his family's business, and instead began to travel the Empire on his own, so as to find a place to fit in. This would lead him to the Capitol, Griffenheim, where he finally enlisted with the Imperial Military, having exhausted all other options.\n\nFinding himself at home amongst the armed forces, Galluzzo spent several years as an NCO until his unit commander paid for him to go through the Kaiser Groverkademie Officer's course in Griffenheim. Galluzzo passed his courses with distinction, and there met his longtime friend and part time rival, Arnold Scheer. The two initially grew to dislike each other, what with Scheer's bookish nature clashing with Galluzzo's outdoorsgriffship, but they came to respect each other during their courses.\n\nAt the time of the Republican Revolution of 978, the two had become friends, and supported each other during the civil war. There, Galluzzo's love of the outdoors bled into his style of warfare, where his active lifestyle and terrain knowledge made the then Hauptmann an excellent field officer.\n\nBy the end of the war, Galluzzo had fought in several difficult battles in difficult terrain, such as mountains and thick forests, winning stunning victories for the Monarchist forces and cementing him his rank of Oberst. Galluzzo is a dedicated proponent of extreme terrain training for the Griffon Imperial Military, and has recently begun to push high command to create a special tasks and training branch of the Imperial Army.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
 GRI_teodor_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 9th of June, 950 in Kivessin\n\n§YRank§!: Generalmajor\n\n§YBiography§!: Born to one of the various Griffon noble houses of Kivessin, Teodor Frolich grew up amongst the wealth and excess of noble life, and much to his parents' chagrin, was not exactly the most morally proper griffon in the world. Fed up with dealing with his excesses, his mother and father shipped him off to the Kaiser Groverakademie Officer's Academy in Griffenheim, where he was beaten into shape by his instructors, and re-moulded into a proper military officer despite his personal failings earlier in his life.\n\nHe easily made his rank as a Junior Officer, having grown up with a decent schooling from his parents. However, his old habits began to creep back into his lifestyle having made a rank, and he was frequently in trouble with his superior officers for inviting his aristocratic friends to outlandish parties requiring the intervention of the Military Constabulary.\n\nThings changed, though, in the year 978, when the Republican Revolution broke out. Frolich, who'd been at the Military Academy celebrating a fellow Aristocrat's Graduation party, nearly panicked and ran when gunfire broke out in the city. Seeing his terrified countrygriffs - barely adults themselves changed something within him, though.\n\nTechnically the highest ranking officer at the Academy, as the instructors held no rank on the basis of being retired officers, Theodor steeled himself and took charge of the situation, snapping out orders in a manner which no one had heard from the aristocratic griffon before. With his troops rallied and the academy's out of date armaments passed out, Frolich organized as good a defense as he could manage, defending the Officer's Academy for nearly a week, until Griffenheim was declared lost to the Republicans. Refusing to just up and surrender himself and his troops, however, Teodor led his soldiers in a fighting retreat out of the Academy and through the city, until they regrouped with the Monarchist armies southeast of the city.\n\nFor his actions, he received the favor of the crown for his calm under extenuating circumstances, and for his later actions during the Republican rebellion, he continued to climb through the ranks, making the prestigious rank of Majorgenerall by 1005, a mere thirty years after his induction into the Empire's officer korps.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup/Flake"

Born in 941 in Greenback as the son of intellectuals, he distinguished himself as being able to sink into a deep concentration state, despite normally being utterly unable to keep his attention on anything else. He originally joined the military as a way to get some ‘real life' experience (his parent's words) before he was going into a life of sheltered academia. \n\nWhatever the motivation of the young Silverfeather, this was certainly not to last, as he found a home in the military, often sinking his mind into solving complex problems. A few kind words from his superior later, he was fast-tracked onto the Groverianische Reich Militärakademie in Helheim where he graduated with honors before being stationed in the outskirts of Griffenheim, or what someone would call ‘the most boring post in the world'.\n\nThis changed when in 978, as a Oberst, the Revolution broke out in Griffenheim. Silverfeather immediately rallied to the Emperor's side, being personally responsible to break through to the Palace to evacuate the Emperor. Since then, Silverfeather has been in the good graces of the Emperor and remains as devoted as during the Revolution to His Majesty and His Royal Highness, the Crown Prince.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

Although his family had long since grown rich due to their ties to the whaling industry. However, Thranx found his family's existence rather dull and as such he would soon find himself enlisting in the Changeling Army.\n\nServing as an enlisted trooper for a full service rotation, Thranx found that he rather enjoyed his time as a infantryling, and decided to remain with the service. On the suggestion of his peers, he used his family's connections to land himself a spot in the Vesapolis Officer's Academy.\n\nFrom there, he graduated near the middle of his class, and would go on to be an infantry commander during the Canterlot Invasion under the then Hivesmarschall Synovial. Although the Invasion ended in failure Thranx would nevertheless continue to steadily rise through the ranks of the Changeling Army, earning the rank of Major in 1005 ALB - coincidentally the same year the Changeling-Griffonian attaché was formed.\n\nThranx, intrigued by the prospect of getting to explore a whole new continent, would go on to become one of the very few Changelings to volunteer to join the attaché. Ultimately this decision would prove rather fruitful for the Changeling, as he found himself right at home both rubbing shoulders with the Imperial nobility, and in helping the now Oberst Synovial run the attaché. Although, it could be said that he has gotten a bit too friendly with the locals - if the tales of his late night dalliances are anything to go by.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

So far he has conducted himself as adequate and level headed if somewhat arrogant superior to the Changelings that makeup the attaché.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Richmay"

Unwilling to pursue the family business, he enrolled into the Bronzehill Border Guard. In 959, his unit fell in an ambush from Whitetail clan raiders. With the unit's officer killed, he assumed the leadership of the unit and heroically fought off the raiders. For his bravery, he was rewarded with a promotion within the Countal Army.\n\nDespite his rudimentary education and low birth, he rose above expectations and served with distinction. Some even expected him to eventually be promoted within the higher ranks of Bronzehill's military. However, after the loss of the Idol of Boreas, he requested to serve in the Barkginian Guard. Due to his low birth, the Guard's rules meant he would have to begin at the lowest rank. Nevertheless, he joined.\n\nHe once again rose above expectations when in 978, he was personally responsible for saving Grover V's life, an act for which he would be rewarded by being promoted to the rank of Haupthetzen and credited by name during Grover V's coronation speech.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Cofido"

He was strong in both mind and soul, fearless in danger and always willing to sacrifice for the greater good. As a child he admired chivalrous knights and wished to join their ranks, but to do so one had to earn the title first. And so he joined the Reichsarmee as soon as he came of age. His courage and exemplary piety meant that within a few years he gained the rank of military chaplain, serving the spiritual needs of his fellow soldiers.\n\nHowever, this was the first time Konrad had to deal with administrative tasks, and he quickly began to despise them. Being a commoner, he had never learned until now, which only contributed to his distaste of paperwork. Oftentimes he delegated it to others while focusing on training. This eventually paid off, when his regiment faced a raid from the Sunstriker clan and suffered heavy casualties. Without Konrad to lead them and improve their morale, they would've lost the battle. For this act he was rewarded with Knighthood, and his dream was realized.\n\nBut the clergy of the Temple of Arcturius had other plans for him. The Prelate of Yale had died of old age and a new one was needed, so Konrad was appointed as he was the least controversial candidate. Soon he began to regret accepting the offer, being overwhelmed with administrative duties while having few if any military ones. This was when his popularity among the commoners began to rise however, and Konrad used this popular support to gain the title of Archon, so he could avoid doing any paperwork. Now he became Archon Proteus III, despite opposition from some of the clergy who accused him of neglecting his duty.\n\nNot long after, the Empire was embroiled in the revolution of 978 and Proteus was delighted to once more fight on the frontline. He lead the Reichsarmee to many victories over the revolutionaries, making his popularity soar among the military. Ever since he has been a friend of Archon Eros, who cooperated with him during the struggle. He is ready to stand by his side to the bitter end if need be.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Niezow"

Infiltrators, who while not fighting with the "honor" of a knight, are highly effective for their intended purpose.

On the flip side, the Changelings are not used to the ideas of mass battle and heavy weaponry. In short, we have a lot to gain by §Gsharing ideas with one another§!."
