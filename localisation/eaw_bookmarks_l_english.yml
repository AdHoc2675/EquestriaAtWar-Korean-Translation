 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A new era has dawned. Fear and uncertainty spreads amongst ponies as the world around them changes rapidly in front of their very eyes. Equestrian leadership is concerned about their neighbours, Stalliongrad and Changelings alike. While the communists in Stalliongrad rapidly industrialise, Queen Chrysalis has managed to centralise her realm around her. Equestria, while concerned about these developments, faces plenty of internal conflicts and problems. A storm is brewing in Equestria, one that friendship alone might not be able to tame."

 EQS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "이퀘스트리아는 셀레스티아 공주의 지도 아래 천년 이상 조화 속에서 살아왔습니다. 한국은 최근 많은 사소한 위협에 직면했고, 우정과 용서의 힘으로 승리할 수 있었습니다. 그러나 상황이 바뀌고 있는 것 같습니다. 이퀘스트리아의 적들이 떠오르면서 확실한 위협이 되어가고 있기 때문입니다. 평화를 사랑하는 포니들은 이제 그들의 국경선에 수많은 적들이 있는 새로운 세계에 들어섰습니다. 이퀘스트리아는 앞으로 닥쳐올 문제들에 어떻게 다가갈까요? 우정과 조화는 여전히 그 해답이 될까요?"
 CHN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "그리 오래되지 않은 과거, 크리살리스 여왕과 그녀의 체인질링들은 이퀘스트리아와 수도 캔틀롯을 점령하기 위해 대담한 침략을 감행했습니다.이퀘스트리아 포니들에게는 다행스럽게도 그것은 패배로 끝났습니다. 이 패배는 포니들에 대한 체인질링들의 분노를 심화시켰습니다. 이 분노를 이용하여, 크리살리스는 자신의 대의에 대한 거의 보편적인 지지를 모았고, 모든 하이브를 그녀의 지배에 통합시켰습니다. 그녀의 통치 하에서, 군대는 현대 화기, 차량, 전술의 도입으로 급진적이고 빠른 현대화를 보아왔습니다. 새로운 전쟁의 시기가 무르익었고, 이번에는 체인질링들이 마침내 적들에 대한 최후의 승리를 거둘지도 모릅니다."
 STG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "이퀘스트리아 북동부 영토에 세워진 스탈리온그라드 소비에트 공화국은 포니들이 모두 평등하게 사는 새로운 사회를 형성하기 위해 최근에 이퀘스트리아와 크리스탈 왕국과 결별했습니다. 불행하게도 오늘날의 스탈리온그라드는 설립 당시 상상했던 것과는 거리가 멉니다. 급속한 산업화는 실패했고, 식량도 부족해졌습니다. 이퀘스트리아의 제재로 기근의 위협은 매우 현실적으로 다가오고 있습니다. 지도력 위기로 불구가 된 공산당은 무능합니다. 다음 선거 후 일단 당이 확실한 지도자를 확보하게 되면, 스탈리온그라드는 다가오는 폭풍을 직면할 수 있을 것입니다."
 OLE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "사슴의 고향, 올레니아 왕국은 오래된 무역 국가입니다. 비록 정치적 불안정과 부패가 많은 문제를 야기시켰지만, 이 나라는 오랫동안 이 지역에서 가장 강력한 무역 강국이었습니다. 그러나 사회의 하위 계층이 가장 큰 고통을 받고 있으며, 불안이 빠르게 확산되고 있습니다. 불법적이고 믿을 수 없을 정도로 부패한 지도자 요한 '자불렌'의 등장에 따라 상황은 더 악화되었을 뿐입니다. 현재의 정당한 왕위 계승자인 벨벳 여왕은 왕위를 다시 차지하기 위한 계획을 세웠으나 그러기 위해서는 도움이 필요합니다. 이퀘스트리아가 과연 여왕을 도와 줄 수 있을까요? 혁명의 불길이 요트랜드 거리를 집어삼킬까요? 사슴은 북쪽 체인질링들의 위협에서 살아남을 수 있을까요?"
 CRY_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "크리스탈 왕국은 세계 무대에 등장한 새로운 국가입니다. 오래 전에, 이 나라는 사악한 폭군 솜브라 왕의 패배 이후 사라졌습니다. 제국은 몇 년 전 그의 귀환과 함께 돌아왔고, 결국 이퀘스트리아의 도움으로 자유가 되었습니다. 이제 이퀘스트리아의 공주 미 아모레 카덴자의 통치 아래, 많은 포니들은 이 어려운 시기에 크리스탈 왕국이 어떻게 발전할지 궁금해 합니다. 크리스탈 포니들이 계속 이퀘스트리아에 충성할까요?, 아니면 다시 한 번 어둠이 찾아올까요?"
 YAK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The proud race of the yaks have always made it a priority to keep their traditions alive. Due to this, they have never shared much interest in politics, whether that be foreign and domestic. However, young Prince Rutherford recently ended their long isolation and befriended Equestria, which dissatisfied the traditionalist jaks of the Jaki-Clan. They abandoned him and instead supported his brother Prince Bradford who now leads the rebellious jaks and wishes to seize the kingdom for himself. The divided yaks must unite before it is too late, for a blizzard forms in the dark horizon. Will their Way of Life endure, or will this new age bring along a new reign?"

 GRF_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With the collapse of the griffon's ancient Empire nearly 30 years ago Nova Griffonia has found itself independent for the first time after 200 years. However due to Nova Griffonia's over-reliance on Imperial industrial goods and military protection she has found herself suffering heavily in the recent years. Her armies are comprised of militias barely held together by their commanders, the economy has practically collapsed, to top it off the many dissidents the old Empire sent to her shores have become more active and violent than ever. The only thing keeping the country together is Governor Teafether's sheer force of will, but no one lives forever..."
 GFF_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Although an unrecognised state by everyone but Nova Griffonia, the Griffon Frontier enjoys some amount of autonomy from its master. The country is far from content, however, as its virtually non existent budget is unable to fund its industry, army or infrastructure. And now, like all the years before, it is about time for Governor Muck to visit Weter, the capital of Nova Griffonia, and ask for funds once more. He would better return with good news, as he has many enemies back at home who would love to take his place..."

This couldn't have been further from the truth.\nOnce the richest lands in the Empire, Wingbardy now sees itself in crisis. The economy, failed parliament after parliament and a costly war with Falcor has lead to the rapid growth of political extremism. Fascists under Guiliou Beakolini prepare to march on Karthin and seize power from the failed government. The Communists have void to stop them. But the King still holds all the cards in his talons.

 AET_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The County of Greifwald has for long been a nation that has mastered the art of balancing between many powers on the griffin continent, as it's located directly in the middle between the Kingdom of Aquileia and The Griffonian Empire. The current establishment of Greifwald has ruled for long already, but the County is troubled by many problems. It's citizens are poor, it's army and industry greatly obsolete. And while the current regime tries it's best to keep everything stable, there exists a small but hardworking anarchistic party there, that could pose a great threat to the government. But more worryingly, there are whispers in the dark of Prelate Ebonwing's great ambitions and plans..."
 JER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of Aquileia is one of the oldest nation on the Griffonian continent. It was around when the Empire was unified for the first time, and it was also one of the first nations who left it. But after that happened, Aquileia itself suffered a coup where it was transformed into a republic, but just like with the Empire, it didn't last. However, the republic burns bright in the memory of the griffons. And that is'nt the only problem Aquileia faces, as ever since Aquileia left the Empire, it has been a sort of rival to it, and if the Empire ever tries to revitalise itself, Aquileia would be the first barrier in their way. But would Aquileia be strong enough to face them?"
 GRW_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Griffon Liberation Army movement was born in the Kingdom of Brodfeld. Sparked by brutality of the king the revolutionary spirit of the griffons of Prywhen inspired an organisation of the resistance against the bourgeoisie. It managed to capture the popular support of peasants and workers throughout the country. For two years a devastating civil war is going on, more characterised by guerrilla warfare and raids than a full-scale war. But now the peasants and the proletariat have picked themselves up to make the final push into the royalists' nest of vipers. From there on, Prywhen will finally have a chance to decide their own destiny."
 MNC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Eriviar and his Sunstriker Bandits have ruled the Whitetail Mountains for years, becoming rich off raiding and pillaging their pony and griffon neighbours. Having become such an issue, the Emperor was forced to deal with them himself. The Emperor and Eriviar thus struck a pact in which the Bandits would receive weapons, manpower and funding from the former in exchange for swearing fealty to the Empire and keeping the Republicans and the Ponies busy. However, many political dissidents and opponents have used this opportunity and moved into Whitetail. A clash between these forces might be unavoidable."
 FAT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Griffonian Republic was born in the chaotic year of 978, when the common griffons had had enough of being used by debauched and corrupt nobility. After that, it assumed power over all of Griffonia, though the local nobility and oligarchs were doing everything they could to undermine the new republican regime - and they succeeded. But all hope for the Republic is not yet lost. The Republic faces many threats from outside and inside the country, and yet the Republican Spirit and dream lives on. Griffonia will be free!"
 DED_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Dread League is little more than a collection of necromancers who live on the fringes of society. After the fall of the Empire of Undeath, the Dread League endures on the fringes of society. The ancient dark magic of the world will always tempt the curious, as they have now. An evil unknown calling has brought together necromancers from across the globe. There, they gather to form the necromancer's council for the time is right to choose a leader to guide them on a path to world conquest once again. Will the mortals be ready to face the oncoming tide, or will hordes of flesh and bone consume them all?"
 HLR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Arcturian Order is an ancient holy order founded around the faith and ideals of the Twelve Temples dedicated to the sanctity of The Holy Light. The Arcturian Order was created for the sole purpose of protecting the living from the foul denizens from the east. Ever since that fateful day nine hundred years ago, they have done their job. Recent years have written a different story however, as something is amiss in the Dread Peninsula. Border raids have increased in frequency and unicorns in the Order have felt dark energies accumulate beyond the borders. The Twelve Temples believe themselves ready to weather the storm. The question is though, are they really ready for this?"
 BAN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Blackrock Bandits are criminals and mercenaries that have formed together to ransack villages, pillage farms and rob unsuspecting enemies. At the top of the bandit food chain stands Blackrock herself. But not all is sunshine and flowers within the Bandit Queendom of Blackrock. To the east, there is a new communist power emerging in Prywhen. To the southwest, Wingbardy is gathering power and could strike towards Blackrock at a moment's notice. And if the Empire to the north ever manages to re-emerge as the great power it once was... then this might be the early death of the Blackrock Bandits. But bandits do not cry or shiver, for they fight on 'til the bitter end!"
 FAL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Falcor is a nation of peace loving griffons that broke away from the Griffonian Empire after it collapsed. Its ruling family has provided stability and harmony to the country for its short existence until the day Wingbardy arrived on their doorstep, demanding new land. They fought a bloody and long war that in the end would cost millions of lives and rob the Principality of its crown jewel, the capitol city of Falcor. With it's capitol lost, army smashed, and citizens divided, the Principality is spiraling into political unrest. For Falcor, their end grows nearer, and it will take a firm claw to guide them through these troubled times."
 ARA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The small Barony of Arantiga is home to a rich history. It was the birthplace of an ancient empire which stretched most of Griffonia. Led by Arantigos Featherin, the Arantigans ruled much of the world. However, the Empire collapsed and the Barony is all that’s left. It has managed to weather the economic hardship of the Groverian Empire’s collapse by tying itself to Wingbardy, but with the southern Kingdom now failing itself, Arantiga must decide if it should remain dependent on the south. Politically, some want to reform the barony into a normal state, based on ideology. However, Dorotheos, a promising general and descendant of the great Featherin, dreams to recreate the ancient Empire."
 FRE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Nestled among the mountains of South East Griffonia, the Ponies of the Long House live simple lives of peace and harmony. An alliance of many small pony Clanns and holy monasteries, Pònaidhean has little interest in the outside world, but the newly elected Crimson nic Heart sees storm clouds gathering over Griffonia.\n\nWith an uncertain future, Pònaidhean must modernise or be left behind. But Pònaidhean and Crimson knows that any change risks upsetting the supernatural forces that also call their hills home."
 LCT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The frontline against the Griffons, Lake City has always had a tumultuous history. Lake City was once the capital of a united River Lands, however years of internal unrest and griffon attacks have worn down the great city to a battle-hardened and bitter nation. But all is not well within the nation. Grand Mayor Springtime Frost took power after his predecessor was assassinated by disgruntled army officers, yet another victim of the division that runs deep through Lakeish society. With the upcoming elections, the ponies of Lake City hope it will be a time for change, but there are those who see the elections as an opportunity to further their own goals."
 NCH_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Greneclyf is a harmonious land of changelings, led by Queen Gytha of Clann Leamhan. The latest of an 800-years-old dynasty, Gytha has adhered to the old philosophies adopted since the times of the First Sharing. These have ensured a peaceful, if monotonous rule.\n\nBut there is change in the air, and the Queen can sense it approaching fast. Her people are ill-prepared for the oncoming storm, and Greneclyf is in need of new relationships with the continentals. The ponies of the River Coalition should be good allies, but having never met changelings before, Greneclyf must put its best hoof forward..."
 WIT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A nation of unicorns, magic, and parties, Wittenland is proud of its meritocracy, where leaders are selected by magical talent, not bloodline. Its ancient traditions of magical scholarship and mountain castles have defended against Griffons and ponies alike for centuries. But times are changing, and the lavish parties of Wittenland hide its archaic economy and oppressed feudal serfs. Queen and reformer, White Star must navigate the intrigues of Wittenland politics if she hopes to bring change to this stagnant nation."
 NIM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since ancient times, Nimbusia has been a democracy ruled by a pegasus warrior class. These stalwart ponies are some of the best trained soldiers in Griffonia, but require a large class of helots to produce for them. The democratic nation has reached turbulent time. Split between those who seek reform, those who want to abolish democracy and those who defend tradition. A smart and wellspoken politician will be able to take advantage of the situation to win over the hearts of the Nimbusians."
 DMT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The vaults of the King of Diamond Mountain are empty, having been robbed clean by griffon knights. The nation of dogs must rebuild, so that King Rover Diamondshield can seek revenge against the thieves. However, trouble is brewing in the underground as slaves seek to revolt. How the dogs of Diamond Mountain deal with this unrest might change their society forever..."
 LUS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The griffons of Lushi have long held on to their backwards ways. The country is divided between powerful lords, who rule over their serfs. These serfs are still tied to their land and largely uneducated. However, the young prince, Elias, seeks to reform the principality by dealing with the lords and setting the serfs free. But his brother Gerar has other plans for the nation, if he can come to power..."
 HLQ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Stalwart defenders of the eastern frontier, the knights of Hellquill have stood long as the Empire's protectors against the Riverpony incursions. But these oaths broke after the Empire's collapse 30 years ago, and now the Hellquillians stand independent, closely tied to their allies in Longsword. The current Grand Master of the Order is old and set to retire soon, and with it, change might come to Hellquill, for the better or worse..."
 LNS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A staunch ally of Hellquill, the small County of Longsword has weathered many assaults from the Riverponies, but they've stood together against the tide, as battle brothers in their separate Knightly Orders. But since they've gained their independence from the Empire, Longsword has enjoyed relative stability until Count Pallas Dusktalon invited members of the Reformisten, a radical group from Hellquill, for assistance against the ponies. Slowly, they've gained power across the entire nation, and now they've begun the cleansing of Longswordian lands from anyone deemed impure, especially ponies..."

 BRF_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of Brodfeld is a young nation whose recent history is full of suffering. From the Great Famine of 995 to the present civil war against communist revolutionaries, griffons of Prywhen have endured much hardship. Some seek salvation from the King and the Gods that aid him while others hope for reforms that will turn the Kingdom into a constitutional monarchy, yet both fight together against the Red Menace that seeks to undo all that they hold dear. Only if they are victorious can they have any hope of seeing their country rise from the ashes like a golden Phoenix."
 SRS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In the frigid, snowy tundras of the Griffonian far north, the Socialist Republic of Skynavia stands as a shaky bastion of egalitarianism, liberty, and socialism in a world that grows darker by the day. Created upon stolen pony territory by exiled socialists in the aftermath of the failed First Griffonian Revolution, the Socialist Republic must strive to maintain their hard-fought freedoms and liberties at home, whilst protecting the dream of a socialist Pan-Griffonia from the forces of reaction that surround and threaten the Republic on every front. Will the Republic finally achieve their utopian ideals in the years to come, or will it crumble under pressure from within and without?"
 VED_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Vedina is a nation with a hard-fought independence, having long kept both Imperial influence and revolutionaries at bay through careful political maneuvering. Its famous knightly institutions that have been a part of Vedina since it's birth have always been ready to defend the borders of their Kingdom. But problems arise as a succession crisis pokes its head into Vedina. King Wingstrom's daughter is not fully ready to rule and she must prove herself if she wishes to become the Queen of Vedina. But what type of Queen will she be? That remains to be seen."
 GRU_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "It has not been long since the free towns of Gryphus regained their golden liberty from the despotic Empire, but already internal strife threatens the country and its treasured freedom. Both fanatical knights from Herzland and a Sicameonese merchant company strive to gain more power, caring little for the desires of the towns themselves. Something must be done soon, ere prized liberty is once again lost..."
 CYA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Once loyal servants of the Empire, Cyanolisia is now stranded, its duty of keeping the minotaurs in check inside and outside their borders growing more difficult each day. The Countess is confident her loyal soldiers will not give up, even as conspiracy spreads among their ranks. Across the gulf, revanchist Asterion gears for war, and Cyanolisia must do everything it can to prepare."
 MIT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The minotaurs of Asterion have grown tired of serving under despots and tyrants and have broken their shackles. Yet the Restoration War failed to claim the mainland, where hundreds of thousands of minotaurs still suffer. Decades have passed since the war and some have turned to more radical ideas as an unusual coalition forms between fascists and communists, yet all minotaurs still agree on one thing: Death to monarchists!"
 SIC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The federation of Sicameon is a country of free griffons, with not a single noble or knight in sight. Nevertheless they have managed to found a stable and prosperous nation, with solid democratic foundations. But they are militarily weak, and as a tropical storm gathers, everyone in Sicameon knows something must be done. But what exactly? No agreement has been made so far, and it must be done soon as elections slowly approach."
 
 STW_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Strawberry Duchy is a place of wine and culture to much of the Griffonian elite, and its ruling family has long been second only to the Imperial lineage of the Grovers. It is the fiefdom of Duchess Gabriela Eagleclaw, and was one of the great champions of the empire during the revolution. Still, not all is well in the Duchy in these days. The Duchess has spent more and more time away from her fiefdom to be in Griffenheim, and some among her subjects wonder if she's forgotten about them. Maybe the time has come for Strawberry to assert itself beyond the duchess' reach? Or maybe dark clouds will gather and Strawberry once again will rise to be the bastion of loyalty it always has been?"
 ANG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Angriver, located in the vast Scheißwald Forest, has always been one of the poorest and most backward regions in the Empire. The dense forest provides refuge for monsters and bandits, as well as impeding development in the region. During the Revolution of 978, Baron Leer remained in control thanks to the support of Großmarschall Stoiber, but since then the two have grown distant, with Stoiber coming to disdain Leer’s cruelty. Today, the Baron's grip over his land is threatened by Republican remnants, Anarchist rebels, and other shadowy conspirators. With so many groups straddling for power, Angriver’s path forward is far from certain."
 PYT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The farmlands of Greifenmarschen were once ruled by a despotic Duke, who was overthrown by the local peasants. Because he had been Emperor Grover I's enemy, they were rewarded with autonomy as long as they remained loyal to the Empire. Thus the Peasants' Republic was born and has continued to exist to this day without much change. A direct democracy with elections every 3 months and referendums held on everything possible, it is highly democratic but also cumbersome. Yet so far, Greifenmarschen has had no need to rapidly change or adapt and has remained content in its rural paradise. That will soon change. Permanently."
 BRZ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "It is said that the only beings the emperor can trust are the dogs of Bronzehill. In 792, Emperor Grover II granted the Bronze Mountains to a group of ex-slaves fleeing Diamond Mountain. Since then the County of Bronzehill has grown and prospered as a loyal subject of the Empire. The dogs of Bronzehill are peaceful, hardworking, and freedom-loving. While they are still Loyal to the Emperor, there are many who now recognise that powerful griffons have been exploiting them. The Collapse of the Empire and the republican uprisings of 978 have further shaken their world view. With dark clouds looming, the hounds of Bronzehill are anxious for what the future might hold."
 KAT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Though situated nearly in the empire's backyard, Katerin is a place struggling to stay afloat in the modern era. What blessings they once had were undone by two great ills. First was the revolution of 978 that saw nearly all of the ruling von Katerinburg family killed as well as much of the city of Katerinburg destroyed, and second was the sole surviving heir to the throne, the crazed Diellza von Katerinburg, whose capricious and brutal reign has left the nation teetering on the brink. Will Katerin rise above its dark past, or will it be choked under the iron claw of its mad princess?"
 YAL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Yale is a nominal vassal of the Griffonian Empire. Having served as the academic centre of the Empire for generations, with Yale’s Rectors eventually taking over the nation. However, as the Griffonian Empire declined over recent years, friction has emerged in the Yale Rectorate. Yale lacks a strong national identity and with the Emperor sicklier than ever, societal divides are deepening. The country’s leader, Rector Mikusian, seeks to lead a moderate course, while revolutionary and reactionary universities try to mobilise the discontent in Yalish society for their own purposes. Will the light of Yale shine bright in the darkness, or will it be snuffed out like so many places of learning before it?"
 FEA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Troubling times have come to the Duchy of Feathisia. Currently ruled by Duke Gerlach IV, who brought about constitutional reforms and prosperity to the nation, disaster hit with the collapse of the great Griffonian Empire and the war that followed. The final blow was struck when Skyfall drove the Feathisian companies out of their markets, leaving the economy in shambles. With poverty rising throughout the country and confidence in the status quo at an all time low, radical socialist and nationalist groups have been gaining power in the turmoil. Can the situation be returned to normal, and Feathisia remain the nation it is? Or will drastic measures need to be taken?"
 ROU_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The city of Romau has for the longest time been an area of political neutrality. As the last remaining Imperial Free City, Romau enjoys greater amounts of economic freedom and military protection than other vassals of the Griffonian Empire. This has caused the City to also become quite dependent on the Empire, however, and its political structure might not survive any further troubles in their main investor and protector. Dark times loom over the Empire, and its fate could very well become the fate of small, little Romau."
 TRD_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In the Trade Federation of Skyfall, the wealthy dominate and pay little heed to the Empire, their former overlord. Its ruler, Iron Chancellor Guichard, has ruled the federation since its foundation, having driven out the Imperial garrison and seized the Imperial Navy. But Guichard is an old griffon, and it is clear he doesn't have much longer to live. The oligarchs see their chance to succeed him, the oppressed workers prepare of revolution, his young niece dreams of democracy, and in the shadows others conspire with the Archons of Griffenheim..."
 FEZ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Like neighbouring Skyfall, Fezera is a prosperous trade port in western Griffonia and birthplace of the iconic Griffonian Fez. However, unlike its rich and famous neighbour, its choice of independence during the Griffonian Revolution didn't produce a golden age. Rather, the city decayed, mired in political turmoil and mobster activities from the penose with only the tireless Fezeraanse Politie preventing total chaos. But one griff rose to the occasion, the Skyfall-born Gwenaël Godard. Following a tumultuous election, he promised to restore Fezera to greatness. Of course, he has absolutely no ties to the smugglers and penose himself despite what some in the Politie claim."
 FLO_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The small but immensely wealthy city of Flowena has managed to secure its independence from both Aquileia and the Empire. Rich bank-owning patricians rule the city with little regard to the common workers, choosing the mayor from amongst themselves. The current mayor, in fact, does very little ruling and a great amount of partying. But recently something has changed about him. He now has greater ambitions, and plans to reveal them to his fellow citizens soon..."
 AVI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "House Avian was once part of the much larger Duchy of Verenia. Its rule was relatively prosperous despite linguistic issues. However the Griffonian Revolution devastated Verenia, leaving many of its members dead and leading to a succession crisis between the House Eyrie and Erie branches of the Duchy. Lady Katrina Avian chose to stay out of the conflict and broke off with what is now known as House Avian. Unfournately this left the succession crisis in a stalemate and the linguistic divide only grew deeper. Will House Avian manage to unite the divided realam and survive through the upcoming storms? Or will it remain a footnote of history in the rise of some greater realm?"
 HAU_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Haukland is one of the numerous splinter-states born out of the Griffonian Empire’s collapse.
